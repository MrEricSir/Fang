<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>
<p>New ads on pay phones seem to mock . . . something. But maybe the tone is what you bring to it. Maybe they&#8217;re meaning to celebrate a lifestyle or demographic that they&#8217;ve identified on some fancy charts as primed for targeting.</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;re in San Francisco, you took some crazy risks, the whole world is in your hands, put the world down for a moment and pick up a can of soda.</em></p>
<p>Or maybe they&#8217;re trying to get us to write and talk about it. So here we are. In that vein, I&#8217;d like to remind you that drinking Diet Coke is <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/13/there-are-dangers-in-drinking-diet-soda.html" target="_blank">probably horrible</a> for your body. You&#8217;d be better off drinking a glass of water. Also, water isn&#8217;t specifically messing with my head to get me to write all this right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://webuiltthiscity.tumblr.com/post/77761337817/id-say-that-i-hope-these-ads-are-a-joke-or-art" target="_blank">We Built This City wondered if they were real</a>, &#8220;I’d say that I hope these ads are a joke or art piece, but they probably aren’t. I mean, seriously? Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>If they are real, <a href="http://www.missionmission.org/2010/06/28/billboard-liberation-front-not-into-smoking/" target="_blank">and not just a new effort from the BLF</a>, I&#8217;m kind of baffled by what they mean. You could swap out their brand with anything else, nothing about it seems to imply that you need Diet Coke, but I guess that&#8217;s just lifestyle advertising.</p>

<p>Have you bought a secondhand dresser from the Sunset sometime in the past few years? If so, pull out the drawers now! If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll find a secret aquatic surprise painted by an <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/mis/4347387809.html">anonymous artist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>About 6 years ago, perhaps longer I was subletting a friends room. While he was away I pulled out all of his dresser drawers and painted underneath them an aquatic scene. I never told him about it and he ended up selling the thing. Do you remember buying a dresser in the sunset? Would you like to take a quick peek under there, you might find a seahorse couple. I don&#8217;t want the dresser back I just want to find out where it went.</p></blockquote>
<p>How magical! And of course, let us know if you happen to be the lucky winner.</p>

<p>Now, on to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2567548/Woman-attacked-wearing-Google-Glass-bar.html" target="_blank">the story</a>.  Over the weekend, tech writer Sarah Slocum <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahaslocum/posts/10102879287900773" target="_blank">vented on Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG so you&#8217;ll never believe this but&#8230; I got verbally and physically asaulted and robbed last night in the city, had things thrown at me because of some wanker Google Glass haters, then some *bleeeeeeeeeep* tore them off my face and ran out with them then and when I ran out after him his *bleeeeeeep* friends stole my purse, cellphone walet and everything..</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, <del>other patrons of Molotov&#8217;s</del> someone working across the street had a different take upon reading the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>That  is not at all what happened. It was after last call, she was wasted and  being a bitch, someone called her a glasshole and her boyfriend tried  to fight the dude, and got his ass whooped. The glasses fell off her  face and someone picked them up and gave them back to her. Nobody robbed  her either, this [person] is making all this shit up. Go Molotovs!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point I thought the name sounded familiar, and I realized I went to school with her, so I reached out with the above version of events.  Sarah went on to continue <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahaslocum/posts/10102885352462343?comment_id=22922033" target="_blank">defending herself on Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn&#8217;t being any sort of a bitch until after I was flicked off, called a bitch, had dirty wet bar rags thrown at me and had people invading my personal space and trying to rip them off my face.</p>
<p>Your &#8220;friend&#8221; must have been one of the people who robbed me or who were friends with the robbers and tech glass haters at that bar and must have been the wasted one because they can&#8217;t even tell the difference between males and females or remember the story correctly. No glasses fell of my face. Those were my friend&#8217;s prescription glasses who defended me and got in a fight with the guy that ripped the glasses off my face and ran out of the bar with them. And if anyone got their ass beat it was the guy that that assaulted me and ran outside the bar with the Google Glasses. The only injuries that my friend has is a scrapped knee. And actually he was jumped by two other **** while he was fighting the douch bag.</p>
<p>I was minding my own biz with a computer phone. Everyone has a computer or phone these days. And what have they done to the city? Given people cool cellphones?? And awesome technology that we all use and take for granted everyday? I realize that I represented the tech millionaires and billionaires in their eyes, but that isn&#8217;t me and I didn&#8217;t even pay for my Google Glasses, one of my developer friends gave them to me because he wasn&#8217;t using them and doesn&#8217;t currently have time to develop an app for them right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the whole story sounds pretty crazy.  There&#8217;s conflicting versions of events and a lot of alcohol involved.  Someone else even sent me this message on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wouldn&#8217;t normally comment on such things but i actually met this girl on the street after the incident happened. Couple of things: It was 2am on a friday night when i met her she was less than sober (she had had approx a small child full of vodka cran&#8217;s) secondly from what she told me it sounded like she left her bag and phone unattended in a busy bar on a friday night. Her friends were so riled up (and obnoxious) that they almost started fighting with me when i argued it maybe wasn&#8217;t the smartest idea to wear google glass and film in a punk rock bar and leaving a bag and phone unattended wasn&#8217;t the wisest of decisions. I left her feeling sorry only for myself that i had spent 5 minutes of my life in her groups bosom.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I don&#8217;t know what happened.  What I do know, however, is that it is absolutely moronic to label this as a hate crime, as <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/we-now-have-a-report-of-a-google-glass-hate-crime-2014-02" target="_blank">Josh Wolford thought fit to do</a>.  Perspective, people.  Please.</p>
<p>(Now, if you want to go ahead and call it a <em>HAIGHT CRIME,</em> by all means be my guest)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.missionmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-10.46.13-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-52445" title="Screen shot 2014-02-24 at 10.46.13 AM" src="http://www.missionmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-10.46.13-AM-560x350.png" alt="" width="560" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>Oh gosh.  So these episodes of Looking are no longer boring, but these recaps certainly will be.  The pace has picked up and on top of all that we&#8217;ve got a whole lot of meaningful silences to dissect and there&#8217;s so much to recap and it&#8217;s all so, so harrowing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few things going on.  Dom&#8217;s turning 40 and the gang is planning a birthday hang in Dolores Park.  Richie is about to meet all of Patrick&#8217;s friends, which prompts them to have the &#8220;are we boyfriends?&#8221; talk that all of us fine boyfriends across the U.S.A. have had at some point.  They decide that yes, they are boyfriends, and Richie gives Patrick an <em>escapulario</em> &#8212; a religious good luck pendant which I guess is like the gay Catholic version of a promise ring or a BE FR / ST IENDS necklace combo?  In any case, Patrick was touched, and accepted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dom is prepping for 40 by hanging out with a couple of old gays and Lynn, hoping to get funding for his Portuguese chicken startup (&#8220;The last thing this city needs is another Zuni,&#8221; one wise old gay says).  Lynn and Dom are business partners in all this, yes, but we&#8217;re increasingly getting the feeling that Dom is heading toward wanting more (Bakula happens, you guys).</p>
<p>Over in Oakland, Agustin, who is my least favorite character and gets more and more upsettingly steampunk with each episode, has his panties all in a bunch because his art sucks (surprise!).  We learn he&#8217;s invited his muse/probable crush CJ (the Thor guy with the bratwurst) to Dom&#8217;s bday, so we&#8217;re all excited because we all know this means sex!</p>
<p>Okay, so THEN, we&#8217;re at Dolores Park for the birthday soiree and EVERYONE is there, so obviously we run into Patrick&#8217;s boss Kevin (the hot Ricky Gervais with the ears) and his boyfriend John!  Patrick introduces Richie to the pair, but not only fails to utter the word boyfriend but belittles his career as a hairdresser as a &#8220;for now&#8221; thing and all that.</p>
<p>And then even WORSE, Agustin buys pot truffles and acts like a dick for the rest of the episode (drugs, you guys!).  He accuses Patrick of &#8220;slumming it&#8221; with Richie, that Patrick just has Richie around to prove a point to the rest of them, and makes fun of their gay Catholic boyfriend necklaces.  Obviously Richie is right behind him and hears everything &#8212; and Agustin tries to apologize to him en Espanol but it&#8217;s like so uncomfortably CLASS CONFLICT that everything basically just turned into a John Hughes movie and I need to fan myself off.</p>
<p>Agustin goes to wallow in his misstep with Frank and CJ (whose only line this episode is: &#8220;I fuckin&#8217; love Cheetos,&#8221; thankfully).  They all go home and obviously have a threesome and film it and shit seems to get a little too real between Frank and CJ and Agustin notices and we know Agustin is like 15 minutes away from a full-on breakdown.  I&#8217;m hoping Agustin gets written off the show and they instead lock CJ in as the character who eats homoerotic snacks 2-3X per episode (outlook: promising!).</p>
<p>Alright.  So meanwhile, Dom continues sulking because he&#8217;s 40 and, even though he&#8217;s been propositioned on Grindr, he goes to hang with Lynn instead (who sent him birthday flowers btw!).  They settle in with cartoons and some pot and Lynn suggests they get the Portuguese chicken startup off the ground as a pop-up.  Dom goes in for a Lynn kiss and Lynn&#8217;s like exqueeze me? and tells him he just wants to be biz partners.  Class act, that Lynn.</p>
<p>Back in the Mission, Richie asks Patrick if he&#8217;s embarrassed of him, because he has transformed into Molly Ringwald before our eyes.  Patrick flashes his best Andrew McCarthy smile and invites Richie to his sister&#8217;s wedding to pacify him (&#8220;I&#8217;ve been slow all my life and that&#8217;s over,&#8221; he says).  We later witness Patrick looking at himself in the mirror, adjusting his gay charm necklace, and I think we know that some of what Agustin said was true.  Patrick IS trying to prove something to himself or someone, or both.  He wants to be a type of guy, but he may not yet be that type of guy.  Oh, Patrick.</p>
<p>Did you know that in the original version of Pretty in Pink, Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer end up together, but it tested poorly with audiences so they went with the Andrew McCarthy ending instead?  They really should have stuck with that first ending, because why you gotta settle for being someone&#8217;s tacky pity girlfriend?  Basically, Richie needs to find himself a Duckie to love because Patrick is kind of a dick and not ready for any of this.  This will all explode before our eyes like a Portuguese chicken startup in the next few episodes, and I&#8217;m gonna be the one crossing my arms and shaking my head like a surly abuela.</p>
<p>No, you hang up!</p>
