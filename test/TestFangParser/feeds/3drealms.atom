<p>3D Realms and Interceptor Entertainment have launched Duke Nukem II for iOS, bringing the classic action game to mobile devices. Slam your thumbs into the screen as you guide Duke across 32 action-packed levels, blasting the living crap out of every alien that dares to get in your thumb-smashing way. <a href="http://evolvepr.createsend1.com/t/j-l-jidkkdl-dhbuhi-o/">The game is now available on the iTunes App Store for just $1.99.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://evolvepr.createsend1.com/t/j-l-jidkkdl-dhbuhi-b/">Check out the game's trailer on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>In 1993 Apogee released Duke Nukem II.  Its explosive action made it an instant side-scrolling classic. 20 years later, Interceptor Entertainment and 3DRealms have teamed up to bring Duke Nukem II back. Duke Nukem II for iOS lets you experience this 90's classic all over again on the most popular gaming platform in the world. Duke 2 is the game that leads up to the moment when Duke 3D begins.  In effect, this game is the backstory to the most famous of all Duke games, a true prequel.</p>

<p>"It's an amazing experience to be able to work on such a beloved franchise," said Frederik Schreiber, CEO and game director at Interceptor Entertainment. "As kids, we were all big fans of Duke Nukem II, and working with Scott Miller and 3D Realms to bring this classic back to life on new platforms was a dream come true. Scott is a great partner, and I'm looking forward to working together on more exciting titles in the future!"</p>

<p>"Before Duke Nukem 3D, before the sunglasses, before the one-liners, and before the strippers - many gamers never knew there was another incredible alien ass-kicking Duke game, a cutting-edge game for its time that still holds up 20 years later," said Scott Miller, CEO and co-founder of 3D Realms. " And Interceptor, the uber-talented up-and-coming studio behind the amazing Rise of the Triad reboot, has ported Duke Nukem II to the iPad and iPhone. I've loved working with Frederik Schreiber and the entire team. These guys know and love Duke like they're family.  And the love shows in this kick-ass release."</p>

<p>3D Realms and <a href="http://www.generalarcade.com/">General Arcade</a> is happy to announce the port of Shadow Warrior to iOS.</p>

<p>Lo Wang.  Master ninja assassin for 20 years.  A Shadow Warrior.  Shadow warriors are the best of the best, and Lo Wang was the best of the Shadow warriors.  Every top company in Japan had a shadow warrior... a protector, a negotiator, a cleaner.</p>

<p>Lo Wang worked for Zilla Enterprises, a conglomerate with control in every major industry.  Too much control.  Power corrupts, and Master Zilla's corporation was corrupted to the core.</p>

<p>Lo Wang discovered Master Zilla's demonic scheme to rule Japan, using creatures summoned from the dark side.  A man of honor, Lo Wang quit.  But one as powerful as Wang either must be on your side, or on no one's side.  Master Zilla unleashes his creations for their first test: to kill a single man, a shadow warrior..  Lo Wang!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.generalarcade.com/">General Arcade</a>:<br />
"Do you know any game for smartphones which does not lead you by the hand through the levels, where enemies need more than one bullet to die, don't wait till you reload the gun, instead they want to kill you as soon as possible to rip out your heart and play soccer with your head?<br />
Such game was released for PC 15 years ago and now it's coming to iPhone and iPad. Shadow Warrior. Available on the AppStore at the end of this year."</p>

New York City is being overrun by a mutant menace and it's time to de-worm the Big Apple. This explosive 3D action game features Duke Nukem defending the city that never sleeps, and its babes, from the evil Mech Morphix across 24 levels from Chinatown to Space. A super-sized collection of weapons, enemies and bosses await. As Duke would say, "Babes, Bullets, Bombs. I love this job!"<br />

<![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Prey Invasion is now live in the App store and the reviews and buzz so far are outstanding.</p>

<p>Here is official PR Line:</p>

<p><a href="http://linktoapp.com/Prey+Invasion">Prey Invasion</a>, the follow-up to the innovative "masterpiece" (Game Informer--9.5/10 rating) console hit, finds Tommy in an all-new adventure on your iPhone and iPod Touch! Tommy takes no prisoners as he plows through new level after level of alien mutations and horrors in search of his girlfriend. </p>

<p>All of the original Prey's innovations are here, including Spirit Walk, Wall Walk and Death Walk. Two fully customizable control schemes are on-board to make your mobile gaming experience a snap, in addition to Prey Invasion's high-performance, super-smooth 3D engine and TapShoot(tm), which allows you to quickly and easily aim and shoot without the frustration of trying to line up your weapon perfectly (a fixed-fire option is available for hardcore players).</p>

<p>Seriously, the TapShoot feature changes the way 3D shooters are played on touch screen devices, removing the frustration of precise aiming, and adding the visceral feel of tapping the screen to mow down enemy targets. Almost assuredly, most future 3D shooters released on the iPhone will copy this feature.</p>

<p>"This is cheap alien-killing fun. No, make that, this is good-looking, cheap alien-killing fun." -- <a href="http://wireless.ign.com/articles/992/992269p1.html">IGN</a> (rated 8/10)</p>

<p>Take a look at these screens -- and yes, this is the iPhone!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>...bet you thought that <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/news/2009/05/goodbye.html">Goodbye</a> meant there will be no more updates ever?  That was a Goodbye from the development team.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm here to report on an update I have posted to the 3D Realms online store.  As some of you may have noticed, 3D Realms ceased shipping physical product right around the time we posted the Goodbye story.  We went to downloads only, and we're here to report that this will remain the same.  3D Realms will no longer ship physical product of any kind.  We are however, continuing to make available our older titles via registered download.  </p>

<p>Available now in the online store is our new product line of registered downloads, most at new lower prices.  This is a complete overhaul, too.  It's not just the same files we had in our old store in a new store.  All of them have been redone with a new installer, and most importantly a new DOSBox wrapper.  Our previous downloads were the original DOS games, which for a lot of people who weren't familiar with the original DOS commands was a difficult thing.  DOSBox gets around that, and all of the old games have this included, so you will be able to run them from Windows quite easily.  The new installers will install the game through Windows (even works in Vista), and you can click on them with icons, and all that good stuff.  :)   This was no easy task to rebuild the entire product line like that.  A major thanks goes out to former 3DR staffer Joe Siegler for doing all of this on his final two days at 3DR.  Also, a big thanks goes to Peter Veenstra from the <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox</a> crew for helping out in testing the builds.  There's no way this could have come together so quickly without these two guys.</p>

<p>But that's not all!   In addition to all the games we previously had in our online store, we've also made some available that we never sold as registered downloads before - or just haven't sold in awhile.  New additions to the 3D Realms online store include Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Terminal Velocity, Death Rally, & Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project!  Also available again after a rather long wait is Balls of Steel!   You can buy all of these, plus all the previously available titles by visiting our online store by visiting <b><a href="http://www.buy3drealms.com">http://www.buy3drealms.com</a></b>.</p>

<p>And if that wasn't enough, don't forget that we have released several of our legacy titles in the past via freeware.  Check out our list of freeware releases <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/games.html#freeware">here</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><img align="right" src="http://www.3drealms.com/wolf3d/images/wolf3d_title.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5">Seventeen years ago, Wolfenstein 3D's intial shareware release came out.   If you are reading this story, you know the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>.  Authored by id, published through us when we were going by the name "Apogee Software", Wolf3D was responsible for a great number of people and companies doing what they do.   The influence of this title goes way beyond what the mere pixels on the screen.</p>

<p>Today the granddaddy of shooters turns 17, as it's original 1.0 shareware release was on May 5, 1992 on the PC - something <a href="http://www.buy3drealms.com/wolfenstein3d.html">we still sell</a> to this day!   </p>

<p>Since then, the game has been ported to a ton of various consoles and systems.   The list includes the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000035Y48/73407921">Super Nintendo</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F3P0FM/73407921">Atari Jaguar</a>, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/mac/action/wolfenstein3d/index.html">Macintosh</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BUENLG/73407921">3DO</a>, Acorn Archimedes (huh?), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006409I/73407921">Gameboy Advanced</a>, and the <a href="http://www.sheppyware.net/software-gs/wolf3d/">Apple IIgs</a>.   Most of these ports have long since been out of print, the links above mostly go to Amazon.com where you can try and get a used copy if you're interested.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein3dclassic/" target="_blank"><img align="left" src="http://www.3drealms.com/wolf3d/images/wolf3d_iphone.png" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0"></a>However, most recently the game was ported to the iPhone by id Software.   You can read about the iPhone version <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein3dclassic/">over at id Software's website</a>, or you can go straight to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=309470478&mt=8">the page for it in the iTunes store</a>.  In researching this article, this author noticed that the iPhone version is on a special sale right now for just $1.99!.  That's a limited time "anniversary price", so you should move on that price quickly.  If you have an iPhone, you should check it out.  </p>

<p>There were other games, too.  Going way WAY back, you have the original "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Wolfenstein">Castle Wolfenstein</a>", and it's sequel, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Castle_Wolfenstein">Beyond Castle Wolfenstein</a>".  These were games that originally appeared on the Apple ][ (and later elsewhere).  The original game was the major inspiration for Wolfenstein 3D (which is frequently called Castle Wolf3D, which it is NOT really called).  Appearing after Wolf3D was a true sequel game, called '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_of_Destiny_(computer_game)">Spear of Destiny</a>" (which had it's own addon packs).  There were other titles named "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>",  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_Enemy_Territory">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>", and most recently, "<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfrpg">Wolfenstein RPG</a>", a game for cellphones from id.  Plus, in the future is a title merely called  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_(video_game)">Wolfenstein</a>", so this franchise is not finished yet!</p>

<p>As we were heavily involved in the original all those years ago, we have several things we have lying around which we're bringing to you in celebration of the anniversary.</p>

<p>The first is something called the "Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades".   The Wolf Super Upgrades was an addon pack for Wolfenstein 3D that we sold during 1994 and 1995.  It comprised several addons for the game, including a map editor, multiple hundreds of maps, a random level generator, and some other related items.  We originally released this as freeware on May 22, 2006, but we have something new to add here.  Today we are releasing a document which we sent to our registered customers back in late 1994 about the Upgrades.  In this pdf (<a href="http://www.3drealms.com/wolf3d/w3d_su_advert.pdf">which you can download here</a>), you can see the sales letter we sent out, the original order forms, as well as a letter sent to people who bought the game.  If you have the old DOS Wolfenstein 3D, <a href="ftp://ftp.3drealms.com/freeware/wolf3dsu.zip">check out the Upgrades pack</a>, there's a lot of cool stuff there, and it's free!</p>

<p>Finally, we have a document which was our internal sell sheet for the game back in early 1992.  If you want view that, <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/tech/hintsheets/Wolfenstein%203D.pdf">click here</a>.  The sell sheet refers to two "trilogies" - this version of the game was long since discontinued, and sold as the more well known "six episode" version of Wolfenstein 3D.  A bit of trivia, episodes 4-6 had their own name, "Wolfenstein 3D: The Nocturnal Missions".  </p>

<p>As we said earlier, we still sell the original all these years later.  You can check out <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/wolf3d/index.html">our page</a> for the game, download a shareware version of the game, and <a href="http://www.buy3drealms.com/wolfenstein3d.html">buy a classic</a>!</p>

<p>Happy birthday William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz!   I guess you're now a Teen Wolf.  har har har.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><img align="right" hspace="5" vspace="7" src="http://www.3drealms.com/images/xboxoriginals.png">One of the lesser noticed features on Xbox Live is something called "Xbox Originals".   This is a feature where complete Xbox 1 games can be downloaded from the Marketplace, and you can play them on your Xbox 360.  If you'd like to read more about the details of the originals program, you can do so <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xboxoriginals/issues.htm">here</a>.   Microsoft used to give this away for free for awhile via "Backwards Compatibility", and that still does work, but they stopped working on free updates to that right about the time that Originals came out on the 360.</p>

<p>Anyway, available now on Xbox Originals are the first two Max Payne games.   These games were both released some years ago when the Xbox 1 was the current console from Microsoft.  They've been out of print on physical media for some time now.  You can occasionally find them for sale cheap still when a store decides to clear out old inventory.  But starting now, you can get them any time you want digitally for 1200 Microsoft Points each.</p>

<p>If you click on the two box art images below, you will be taken to each game's respective page on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace.   From there you can use another little known, but very cool feature where you can buy the game online, and then the next time you turn on your 360, it will start downloading immediately.   That works for anything in the Marketplace online.   Check 'em out:</p>

<div align="center">

<p>Effective immediately, you can buy Duke Nukem 3D for Xbox LIVE Arcade via Amazon.com.   Amazon has an Xbox LIVE store where you can buy the game through them and you get a coupon code which will allow you to download the game over XBLA.  This has a couple of advantages over buying directly through your Xbox 360.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to buy a copy for a friend, you can do that now.
<li>You don't have to use "Microsoft Points" (this uses real dollars), so you only have to spend exactly the amount of money you want, not have all those extra points unused in your MS account.

Apparently the folks over at Crispy Gamer remember that too.   Today they're launching the high class look back at games entitled "<a href="http://www.crispygamer.com/features/2009-04-01/crispy-gamer-presents-worlds-greatest-videogame-toilets.aspx"><strong>The World's Greatest Videogame Toilets</strong></a>".  In this series, they plan on covering the 30 greatest toilets in videogames.  They started the series with the toilet from Duke Nukem 3D, which you can see below.   We checked, this is not an April Fools' joke from Crispy Gamer, they're apparently going to spend 30 days talking about potty humour.  Here's what they said about Duke 3D:</p>

<blockquote>For many gamers, Duke Nukem 3D represents the very first time we discovered a toilet in a videogame. I honestly can't recall seeing a toilet in a game prior to this. And you never forget your first time. The toilets you're about to see can be found inside the movie theater in the game's opening level. Yes, this was the age of sprites, so the game's urinals, while functioning, appear to be drawn onto the game's walls with an old, dried-out Sharpie. Warning: Brace yourself for the surprise behind Door No. 2.</blockquote>

<p>They also have a video showing the toilet in action.  You can check that out <a href="http://www.crispygamer.com/features/2009-04-01/worlds-greatest-videogame-toilets-duke-nukem-3d.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><img align="right" src="http://www.3drealms.com/duke3d/images/dntrilogy_logo.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">As this week is GDC week, details about a lot of games are starting to come out, and that's what this story is about.   Some details on the "Duke Nukem Trilogy" have come to light.   First off, 3D Realms is not developing this title, but given the nature of the game, we figured 3DR fans would want to know about it, so we're bringing it to you here.  The games are coming out under the newly revived Apogee Software label, and the games are actually being developed by Frontline Studios.  That latter name should be familiar to 3DR fans, as they've done several other Duke related cel phone games in the past.</p>

<p>The "Duke Nukem Trilogy" will consist of three games (obviously) released one at a time.  The first is scheduled to be released in September 2009 on the Nintendo DS & the PSP handheld platforms.   Each game has it's own title, the first being "Critical Mass".   Each title will have it's own setting, from the future to World War II, etc.   While the Trilogy ends with World War II, the first entry, Critical Mass, begins with Duke in the future. The second title, Chain Reaction, puts Duke in the present day.  It's not until the last game, Proving Grounds, that the action hero proves his worth in the Second Great War.   Release dates for the second and third episodes are not available yet.</p>

<p>The games are currently being shown on the floor at GDC 2009, <a href="http://www.ohgizmo.com/2009/03/25/gdc09-apogee-previews-duke-nukem-for-psp-and-ds/">check out this news report</a> for some thoughts about the games from GDC.  You can also read about the game over on Shacknews <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57852">here</a> and <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=932">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition there are previews for Critical Mass online <a href="http://au.psp.ign.com/articles/966/966065p1.html">at IGN</a> and at </p>

Apogee and it's distributor Deep Silver are running a contest where anyone can enter to be the next Duke Nukem actor.   You might remember a guy who used to appear at trade shows as Duke in the late 90's and into the early 2000's.   You could be that guy.   Here's the details from <a href="http://www.dukeisback.com">the website for the search</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>We are doing what no one in video games has ever done before. We are searching for the next Duke Nukem action hero. We're reaching out to the fans with a 3 city nationwide search to find the next real life Duke Nukem. Or you can click here to send us a your audition by mail. Deep Silver and Apogee Software are calling on all Duke fans to answer the call, to be The Next Duke Nukem.

<p>We want you to come out and audition to be the next Duke Nukem. The winner will get to travel around the world representing Deep Silver as the new official Duke Nukem and get paid to do it. They will be the new face of the franchise and get to interact with the world like no other iconic video game character ever has.</em></blockquote></p>
