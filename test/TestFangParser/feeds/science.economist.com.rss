      <title>Climate change: Jet set</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;CLIMATE change is supposed to unfold slowly, over decades. But that is not true up in the great white north, as those attending this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science&amp;nbsp;were reminded in the session on climate change in the Arctic. Temperatures there are 2°C higher than their long-term average (around twice the increase in the rest of the world), and the upper layers of parts of the Arctic Ocean are hotter than they have been for at least 2,000 years. Summer sea ice has been vanishing faster than even the gloomiest researchers thought likely, with some now predicting the first completely ice-free summer as soon as the 2020s.The Arctic is not, though, isolated from the rest of the world; rapid changes there could have knock-on effects elsewhere. Whether or not that is happening was a question addressed by Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University. It is a topical subject. Along with much of the rest of America, Chicago endured a fierce and prolonged cold snap in January, in which temperatures fell to -27°C, the lowest since 1884. Meanwhile, Brits at the conference were fleeing a country that had been...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Restoring paintings: Artful illusion</title>

&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The black and white truth?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;IN 1959 C.P. Snow, a British chemist and novelist, gave a lecture called “The Two Cultures” in which he lamented the uncomprehending divide between those educated in the sciences and those who owe their allegiance to the arts. Snow would have been cheered, presumably, by a set of lectures at this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science&amp;nbsp;which went some small way to bridging that divide, by discussing scientific methods to analyse and restore works of art.Participants were told about developments in the analysis of paintings using particle-accelerator beams, to reveal discarded works or first drafts hidden under subsequent layers of paint. They also heard about the latest techniques for the chemical analysis of paint, which permit the analyst to nail down when a work was painted. One of the most interesting talks was given by Jens Stenger of Yale University. He described a project that has employed a scientific illusion to restore the appearance of a set of faded paintings by Mark Rothko, an American abstract expressionist who is pictured.The pictures in question were...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Olfactory communication: Spot the difference</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TO TELL a hyena it stank would not be an insult. It has been known for decades that these animals communicate using a pungent material called hyena butter. This forms in pouches next to their anuses and they smear it onto plants for other hyenas to sniff and draw conclusions about the depositor.It has also been long suspected that the smell—mainly the result of small fatty-acid, ester and alcohol molecules—is generated not directly by hyenas themselves, but rather by bacteria that live in the pouches. The details, however, are obscure. They are less obscure now, though, thanks to the work of Kevin Theis of Michigan State University, who has spent much of his career analysing the contents of hyena pouches. And, at a session at this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he shared his conclusions with an eager audience.There are four species of hyena, three of which are solitary and one gregarious. Dr Theis compared one of the solitary species, the striped hyena, with the gregarious one, the spotted hyena, which lives in clans that have as many as 90 animals in them. Spotted-hyena society is a dominatrix’s dream: the girls are very much in charge, and even have pseudopenises which they show off to cow the males.One of the things Dr Theis was looking for was systematic differences in the butter of the two sexes, and of female butter in...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Power and beauty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;SUNLIGHT is free, but that is no reason to waste it. Yet even the best silicon solar cells—by far the most common sort—convert only a quarter of the light that falls on them. Silicon has the merit of being cheap: manufacturing improvements have brought its price to a point where it is snapping at the heels of fossil fuels. But many scientists would like to replace it with something fundamentally better.John Rogers, of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is one. The cells he has devised (and which are being made, packaged into panels and deployed in pilot projects by Semprius, a firm based in North Carolina) are indeed better. By themselves, he told this year’s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, they convert 42.5% of sunlight. Even when surrounded by the paraphernalia of a panel they manage 35%. Suitably tweaked, Dr Rogers reckons, their efficiency could rise to 50%. Their secret is that they are actually not one cell, but four, stacked one on top of another.Solar cells are made of semiconductors, and every type of semiconductor has a property called a band gap that is...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Condom technology: Sheathing Cupid’s arrow</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;THEY have been made of tortoiseshell and horn. They have been made of the finest silk and the coarsest leather. They have been made of pigs’ bladders and sheep’s intestines. They have been made of rubber (natural and synthetic). They have been made of plastic. But none of these has quite fitted the bill. Condoms, though 15 billion are manufactured each year, and 750m couples use them, are not, when push comes to shove, that popular. In truth, they are awkward passion-killers that have a disturbing tendency to pop off at inconvenient moments.Build a better condom, then, and maybe the world will beat a path to your door. That, anyway, is what a select band of researchers in laboratories around the world hope will happen. So does Bill Gates, whose foundation is backing some of these efforts with grants of $100,000 apiece as seed money, and the promise of up to $1m more if the initial experimentation comes good.Mr Gates’s foundation, the biggest non-governmental source of cash for global health, is interested in condoms for the same reasons most users are. Not only do they prevent unwanted pregnancies, they also stop the transmission of venereal infections—...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cancer: Secondary goals</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20140215_STP002_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;THE most insidious thing about cancer is its tendency to spread. A lone primary tumour can be tackled by knife or radiation beam, as well as drugs, with a reasonable hope of success. But once it has metastasised, and spread secondary cancers around a patient’s body, such treatments are much less likely to be effective for any length of time. Stopping metastasis would thus be a great achievement. And a device created by Matteo Moretti of the Galeazzi Orthopaedic Institute, in Milan, and Roger Kamm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, may be a step towards that goal. Their invention, which they describe in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Biomaterials&lt;/em&gt;, is a lab-on-a-chip that mimics the metastasis of breast cancer into bone marrow.One of the mysteries of metastasis is why migrant cells from different sorts of primaries prefer to set up home in particular types of secondary tissue. To test their device the two researchers studied the well-established proclivity of breast-cancer cells (pictured above) to colonise bone. They wanted to look at the hypothesis that in this case the attraction is between a signalling molecule called CXCL5, which bone cells use to talk to...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A stairway to heaven?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;TERMITES are synonymous for most people with destruction. Given half a chance, they will chew up a house as soon as its owner’s back is turned. But entomologists have a different point of view. They are more likely to wax lyrical about the insects’ talents for construction.Termite mounds may reach as much as three metres towards the sky—quite an achievement for animals that are but a few millimetres long. And these mounds are not mere piles of earth. They have clever air-conditioning systems, which use convection to keep things cool; some are even aligned north-to-south, to avoid the worst of the midday sun. Termites also build sheltered tunnels from their mounds to the outside world, to keep themselves safe while they are foraging.Individual termites are, of course, far too dim to understand such things as convection and solar flux. Instead, a few simple rules encoded in their nervous systems by evolution and regulated by signalling chemicals called pheromones steer them to produce their mounds in all their architectural glory. This kind of behaviour, in which simple actions combine to produce sophisticated...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bionics: Once more, with feeling</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20140208_STP003_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Welcome my son, welcome to the machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;ONE of the few upsides of war is that it often gives technology a boost. A notable beneficiary of this is the science of prosthetic limbs. The various conflicts of the past decade have produced a steady stream of soldiers returning with missing arms and legs, and spurred efforts to improve mechanical replacements for them.As a result, modern prosthetic limbs can move around much more fluidly, and sport features such as individually controllable fingers. Artificial arms and legs have been developed that are attached to the severed nerves in an amputee’s stump, and can thus be moved the way natural limbs are, simply by thinking about it. Scientists have even made some progress in the other direction—transmitting sensory information from a prosthesis back to a user’s brain.The most impressive example so far is described in a paper in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, in which Stanisa Raspopovic of the BioRobotics Institute at the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, in Pisa, and his colleagues explain how they built an artificial hand that can transmit the sensation of touch back to its...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gene therapy: Ingenious</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;IT SOUNDS like science fiction, and for years it seemed as though it was just that: fiction. But the idea of gene therapy—introducing copies of healthy genes into people who lack them, to treat disease—is at last looking as if it may become science fact.The field got off to a bad start, with the widely reported death of an American liver patient in 1999. In 2003 some French children who were being treated with it for an immune-system problem called SCID developed leukaemia. Since then, though, things have improved. Indeed one procedure, for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (which causes high levels of blood fats, with all the problems those can bring), has been approved, in Europe, for clinical use.The most recent success, announced last month in the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, was of an experimental treatment for choroideremia, a type of blindness. This is caused by mutation of the gene for a protein called REP1. Without REP1, the eye’s light receptors degenerate. Robert MacLaren of Oxford University used a virus to deliver working versions of the REP1 gene to the most light-sensitive part of the retina. Five of the six participants in the trial duly experienced...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Athletic enhancement: Breathe it in</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;XENON is one of the shyest members of the periodic table of the elements. Chemically, it is almost inert, and physically, it makes up only 0.000009% of the atmosphere, so it is not surprising that it was among the last of the naturally occurring elements to be identified, in 1898. Biologically, however, it is not shy at all. In some countries, notably Russia, it is used as an anaesthetic. It is also known to protect body tissues from the effects of low temperatures, lack of oxygen and even physical trauma. In particular, it increases levels of erythropoietin, also known as EPO, a hormone that encourages the formation of red blood cells.Xenon’s protective and EPO-boosting properties mean it is being investigated as a treatment for babies whose brains have accidentally been starved of oxygen during birth, and of adults who have had heart attacks. But it is also, in Russia, being used as a way to improve athletic performance.Xenon works its magic by activating production of a protein called Hif-1 alpha. This acts as a transcription factor: a chemical switch that turns on production of a variety of other proteins, one of which is EPO. Artificially raising levels of EPO, by injecting synthetic versions of the hormone or by taking so-called Hif stabilisers (drugs that discourage the breakdown of Hif-1 alpha), is illegal under the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sexual selection: Hot wheels</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-float-290&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;IT IS unfair, but true, that beautiful people are more successful than ugly ones. Data indicate that this rule applies in both business and politics—and biological theory suggests the underlying reason is that beauty is an indicator of good genes and good health. How that reason translates into success, though, is more questionable. It could be that the pretty and handsome get a helping hand from their colleagues, bosses (and, in the case of politicians, voters) which is denied to the plain and the unseemly. Or it could be that beautiful people’s underlying qualities mean they really are better, on average, at doing things.One way to disentangle these explanations is to look at a field of endeavour which is about as close as it is possible to get to a true meritocracy: professional sport. Though favouritism here might put you in the team, it will never land you on the winner’s podium. Erik Postma, of the University of Zurich, has therefore done just that, using long-distance cycling as his example. His results, just published in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that good looks really do reflect underlying fitness, in both the athletic and the...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creativity and cheating: Mwahahaha…</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FROM James Moriarty to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the idea of the evil genius has been a staple of storytelling. But is it true? Or, to put the matter less starkly, is there a connection between creativity and dishonesty in real people who are not bent on world domination, as well as in fictional supervillains? Writing in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, Francesca Gino of Harvard University and Scott Wiltermuth of the University of Southern California suggest that there is—and that cheating actually increases creativity.Dr Gino and Dr Wiltermuth tested the honesty of 153 volunteers with a task that involved adding up numbers for a cash reward, which was presented in a way that seemed to them to allow them to cheat undetected (though the researchers knew when they did). This was sandwiched between two tests for creativity, one of which was to work out how to fix a candle to a cardboard wall with a box of drawing pins*, and the other a word-association test. This combination showed not only that creative people cheat more, but also that cheating seems to encourage creativity—for those who cheated in the adding-up test were even better at word association than their candle-test results predicted.That result was confirmed by a second set of experiments, in which some people were given many opportunities to cheat and others few. The crucial predictor of creativity, the...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moths and sloths: Slow food movement</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20140201_STP002_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;SLOTHS are not exactly renowned for their energetic lifestyles, but the three-toed version of the animal takes lethargy to a whole new level. Unlike its two-toed relative, which forages widely if slowly across the tree tops, it lives out its life in as little as 3,000 square metres. It has the slowest digestive rate of any mammal, and about half the metabolic rate typical for its mass—for it maintains a low body temperature even when allegedly active.Once a week, however, it takes a gamble. It climbs slowly down from the canopy, makes a small hole in the ground, and defecates. This is hazardous. Being caught on the ground by a predator such as a coyote or a feral dog is the leading cause of death amongst sloths. And even if it avoids being eaten, the trip consumes 8% of its daily energy budget. Given that two-toed sloths happily relieve themselves from the safety of the canopy, the three-toed’s fastidious lavatorial habits are puzzling. But a study published in the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society&lt;/em&gt;, by Jonathan Pauli of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, not only seems to solve the mystery, but also sheds light on one of...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Human evolution: Kissing cousins</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;HOW Neanderthal are you? That question sounds vaguely insulting. But unless you are African, or of recent African ancestry, the answer is likely to be 1-3%.Though &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; is the only type of human around at the moment, that was not true until recently. Sixty thousand years ago, when modern humans first left Africa, they encountered other species of humanity, such as Neanderthals (imagined above, in an artist’s interpretation), in Europe and Asia. In some cases, they interbred with them. The genetic traces of those encounters remain in modern human genomes. And two studies, one just published in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and one in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, have now looked in detail at this miscegenation, and tried to understand its consequences.The &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study, conducted by Sriram Sankararaman of Harvard Medical School and his colleagues, looked at the genomes of 1,004 living people of European and Asian descent and compared them with Neanderthal DNA from a 50,000-year-old toe bone found in a Siberian cave, and also with the genomes of 176 west Africans. This latter group, Dr Sankararaman assumed,...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preventing anaphylaxis: Not a nutty idea</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“MAY contain nuts” appears so often in the ingredients lists of processed foods that it might seem to most people to have the warning value of the boy who cried “wolf” in Aesop’s fable. Allergy to nuts, particularly to peanuts (strictly legumes, not nuts), is not, however, to be treated lightly. The anaphylactic shock provoked is always nasty and can, if the swelling obstructs someone’s airways, kill.Youngsters who have peanut allergy, and their parents, may therefore be interested in a study by Andrew Clark and Pamela Ewan of Cambridge University Hospitals, which is reported in this week’s &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. This suggests that the immune system (whose adverse reaction causes anaphylaxis) can be trained to become less sensitive to peanuts, to the point where accidental exposure to small amounts of them will cause no harm.The two researchers made this discovery by recruiting 100 peanut-sensitive youngsters aged between seven and 16 and asking half of them to eat increasing amounts of peanut protein daily, up to 800mg (roughly equivalent to five peanuts) for 26 weeks, and the other half to continue avoiding foods containing them for the same period. That done, they were tested to see how much peanut protein they could tolerate. Those in the second group were then asked to behave as the first group had done for another 26 weeks, and tested again.In the first group...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Melting ice shelves: Filmy firn</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-float-290&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20140201_STP003_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Greenland’s firny mountains&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;FIRN is the name given by glaciologists to the partly compacted snow which lies, sometimes hundreds of metres thick, on top of glaciers, ice shelves and ice sheets. It looks like wet sugar and, as is also true of sugar, it has a lot of space between its granules. This means it can absorb meltwater in the way a sponge does. In the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Journal of Glaciology&lt;/em&gt; this week, Peter Kuipers Munneke of Utrecht University in the Netherlands and his colleagues argue that this absorptive power is crucial to the stability of the world’s ice shelves—and therefore of the global sea level. That is because when the sponge is full, any surplus leaks into crevasses beneath the ice. There, it prises those crevasses further open, a process called hydrofracturing. Weaken an ice shelf enough in this way and it will disintegrate, as happened to the Larsen B shelf in Antarctica in 2002.Worryingly, according to Dr Kuipers Munneke, rising temperatures mean firn’s absorptive capacity is shrinking, as the volume of meltwater exceeds the capacity of the new firn created by fresh snowfalls to suck it up. If this trend...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Acacia, ants and antibiotics: Protect and survive</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-float-290&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20140125_STP001_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Home, sweet home&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;THE symbiosis between bullhorn acacias and &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Pseudomyrmex ferruginea&lt;/em&gt;, the bullhorn acacia ant, is the stuff of biological legend. The acacias provide the ants with food, in the form of protein, fat and sugar secreted for their delectation by special organs called Beltian bodies, and also with homes, in the hollow thorns which give the plant its name. The ants reciprocate by stinging anything—from other insects to cattle—that dares try to eat the acacia’s leaves. The latest research, though, suggests that the ants do more than just drive away herbivores. They also act as a sort of immune system which protects acacias from infection.This discovery, reported in &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;New Phytologist&lt;/em&gt; by Marcia Gonzalez-Teuber of La Serena University, in Chile, dates back to an observation made a decade ago that macaranga trees, which have similar symbiotic relations with ants, seem immune to a particular fungus when ants are present, but not when they aren’t. Dr Gonzalez-Teuber wondered if something like this was true of acacias—and if it was, why.To try to find out she chose ten wild acacia...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Computer security: Spam in the fridge</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“THE internet of things” is one of the buzziest bits of jargon around in consumer electronics. The idea is to put computers in all kinds of products—televisions, washing machines, thermostats, refrigerators—that have not, traditionally, been computerised, and then connect those products to the internet.If you are in marketing, this is a great idea. Being able to browse the internet from your television, switch on your washing machine from the office or have your fridge e-mail you to say that you are running out of orange juice is a good way to sell more televisions, washing machines and fridges. If you are a computer-security researcher, though, it is a little worrying. For, as owners of desktop computers are all too aware, the internet is a two-way street. Once a device is online, people other than its owners may be able to connect to it and persuade it to do their bidding.On January 16th a computer-security company called Proofpoint said it had seen exactly that happening. It reported the existence of a group of compromised computers which was at least partly comprised of smart devices, including home routers, burglar alarms, webcams and a refrigerator. The devices were being used to send spam and “phishing” e-mails, which contain malware that tries to steal useful information such as passwords.The network is not particularly big, as these things go. It contains around...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Malaria eradication: Cure all?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-image-full&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20140125_STP003_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;  width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;WHAT if it were possible to get rid of malaria? Not just bring it under control, but wipe it from the face of the Earth, saving 660,000 lives a year, stopping hitherto endless suffering, and abolishing a barrier to economic development reckoned by the World Bank to cost Africa $12 billion a year in lost production and opportunity? It is an alluring prize, and one that Li Guoqiao, of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, thinks within reach.Dr Li is one of the researchers who turned a Chinese herbal treatment for the disease into artemisinin, one of the most effective antimalarial drugs yet invented. Now he is supervising experiments in the Comoros, using a combination drug therapy based on artemisinin, to see if malaria can be eradicated from that island country. If it works, he hopes to move on to somewhere on the African mainland, and attempt to repeat the process there.The current approach to dealing with malaria is to control the mosquitoes (one of which is pictured above) that spread it—either by killing them with chemical insecticides or by draining the bodies of stagnant water that their larvae live in. That has worked in many places. In Europe, for...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
