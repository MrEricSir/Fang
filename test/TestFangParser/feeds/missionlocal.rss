				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As construction nears completion at V20, the 18 unit condo at 20th and Valencia, Sutter Pacific Medical Foundation plans to open a medical facility in the ground floor commercial space – if it&#8217;s approved by the Planning Commission.  Some Valencia Street neighbors, however,  are working to prevent that from happening or at least working to get it downsized.</p>
<p>The medical center would include various services, including physician&#8217;s offices, equipment for tests and lab work. It would also take up the full 7,100 square-foot corner space. Its large size requires conditional use approval from Planning because Valencia Street is zoned for 3,000 square-foot retail spaces.</p>
<p>Its large size also means that the Valencia Corridor Merchants Association has opted to oppose the project when it heads to the Planning Commission May 21. It&#8217;s also raise debate among members of the Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not going to be cohesive with a neighborhood that is famous for lots of retailers and restaurants, it&#8217;s this big behemoth medical center,” said Jefferson McCarley, a spokesperson for the Valencia merchants. “They want to be able to put this big gigantic thing that is above and beyond what the planning code allows, that code was put in for a reason.”</p>
<p>Jenifer Turnbull, a vice president of facility development for Sutter, says the medical facility will work to be a good neighbor and plans for its storefront facing Valencia Street to have a retail-like feel.</p>
<p>“I do think we will be good neighborhood partner, providing health services for everyone from kids to geriatric folks,” said Turnbull. “We&#8217;re working hard to make it a more active space, with glass windows, and weekend and after hours services. We also think bringing primary care is really a benefit to the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Turnbull also said that Sutter chose the Mission because it&#8217;s one of the medically underserved neighborhoods listed in the Department of Public Health&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/HCSMP/Final/FINAL-HCSMP-October2013.pdf">2013 Health Care Services Master Plan</a>.</p>
<p>McCarley says that Valencia Street isn&#8217;t right for a project that&#8217;s so big, but a group of merchants on the corridor would support Sutter&#8217;s arrival if it didn&#8217;t take up the entire corner.</p>
<p>“We welcome Sutter to the neighborhood, even to Valencia street,” said McCarley. “We would love it if they could take the second floor. Or allow retailers to contribute to the vibrancy of the street by taking a slightly smaller space behind the storefront space.”</p>
<p>McCarley says the medical facility could slow down foot traffic for shoppers traveling down Valencia.</p>
<p>Turnbull says that Sutter won&#8217;t feel like an office, that if it moves into the space the company could include a shop for its Institute of Health and Healing, which practices western medicine and eastern therapies and sells various nutritional and health supplements.</p>
<p>Lowering the project&#8217;s footprint also isn&#8217;t an option, according to Turnbull. She says Sutter hopes the facility can provide as many services in one location for patients as possible, which she says includes those on most insurance plans including Medicare and Medi-Cal.</p>
<p>“We like to aggregate services so patients can come to one place to get everything done,” said Turnbull, adding that they need a space as big as the one at 20th and Valencia to create that kind of convenience. “There&#8217;s not a lot of available space in this part of the city, not the kind of spaces we can provide this breath of services.”</p>
<p>Because Sutter is a medical facility it doesn&#8217;t technically fall under the category of formula retail, which is limited on Valencia Street. But McCarley says the Planning Department should treat it as such. St. Luke&#8217;s Hospital on Cesar Chavez and Valencia is also a Sutter facility.</p>
<p>On Monday May 11, representatives from Sutter will present at a community meeting organized by the Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association at 953 Valencia Street at 7 p.m.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On September 11 2014, Sherry Baltonado was at work at Civic Center Secondary School when she read in the newspaper about the fatal stabbing of a 20-year-old in the Mission District. The mother of her own 20-year-old the news item shook her.</p>
<p>Later that day, when the police called, she learned that the young man killed at the corner of 24th and Capp was indeed her son, <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2014/09/remembering-ronnie-goodman/" target="_blank">Ronnie Goodman</a>.</p>
<p>Since that moment, Baltonado&#8217;s life has been transformed. Her daily existence is defined by the loss.</p>
<p>“How do we go on when we feel our world has stopped,” said Baltonado this week. “For the rest of the world it&#8217;s been eight months, but for me it feels like hardly any time has passed. It&#8217;s May now for everybody else, but for me, it&#8217;s like January.”</p>
<p>Baltonado describes life since the death of her son as a boxing match—“every day is me and Mayweather”—the pain manifesting itself as anxiety, physical exhaustion, and anger. She has taken a prolonged medical leave from work and is in counseling for post traumatic stress. But in the grieving process, she has also found a new community and new purpose through an organization called <a href="http://www.mothersincharge.org/">Mothers in Charge.</a></p>
<p>Mothers in Charge organizes women who have lost children to violent homicide. A national organization, based in Philadelphia, it functions as both a support network for families dealing with trauma and an advocacy organization for various connected issues. They partner with gun control activists and lobby for funding for victims services.</p>
<p>On Mothers Day, the Bay Area chapter of Mothers in Charge is hosting a rally at San Francisco Civic Center with speakers, music, and various other performances. But more than anything, it&#8217;s a space where mothers who have experienced tragic loss can come together and not be alone.</p>
<p>“These group of women that have lost family, they become our family,” said Mayline Baltonado, Sherry&#8217;s daughter and Ronnie Goodman&#8217;s older sister. “When you go through something like this, you learn that there are some people that get it, and there are some that don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>“If you never lost a child, there is no way you relate to this,” says Sherry. “The circle that I have now are the mothers who have lost someone.”</p>
<p>“These women have real compassion for us, since they&#8217;re going through it too,” said Mayline.</p>
<p>At the community room in the housing complex where she lives in Berkeley, Sherry says she once hosted Puerto Rican dance groups, now she&#8217;s hosting grief support groups for mothers like her.</p>
<p>“I used to dream of being a dancer, now I&#8217;m dream of being an activist,” she said.</p>
<p>Almost immediately following the death of her son, Sherry got connected to Mattie Scott, Mothers in Charge&#8217;s San Francisco chapter leader. Scott, whose own 24-year-old son was killed in 1996, offered Sherry support and helped her get access to various victim services.</p>
<p>She also recruited Sherry to be part of the network of Mothers in Charge and get involved.</p>
<p>“Ronnie isn&#8217;t the first young man to get killed in San Francisco, and he isn&#8217;t the last,” said Sherry.</p>
<p>Following January&#8217;s quadruple homicide in the Western Addition, Sherry was one of the many women from the non profit who helped served food at one of the victim&#8217;s funeral receptions.</p>
<p>Sherry says that getting involved has “been part of the healing process.”</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a process that has been far from easy. <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2014/10/sfpd-make-arrests-in-killing-of-ronnie-goodman/" target="_blank">Since the arrest of Javier and Luis Gutierrez</a>, the two brothers suspected of Ronnie&#8217;s murder, Sherry and her daughter Mayline have made frequent visits to court during the trial&#8217;s discovery phase.</p>
<p>For the most part Sherry and Mayline have yet to learn what was possibly motivating their son and brother&#8217;s killers or many details surrounding his murder. Sherry said her son never got in fights and wasn&#8217;t involved in any gangs. The Gutierrez brothers have pled not guilty and it&#8217;s the beginning of a long trial process.</p>
<p>“We get tested when we go to court, you&#8217;re face to face with these people,” said Mayline.</p>
<p>As an employee of San Francisco Unified School District, Sherry knew the Gutierrez family prior to her son&#8217;s death. When she saw Luis and Javier&#8217;s mother in court for the first time, she saw the agony on her face and gave the other mother a big hug.</p>
<p>“They came from good family, but it was a terrible choice they made,” said Sherry.</p>
<p>Daily reminders trigger Sherry&#8217;s trauma, such as ambulances, hospitals, and police. And she says that holidays bring up a lot of anxiety. She says she&#8217;s looking forward to Sunday&#8217;s event, but it won&#8217;t be easy. She says it&#8217;s all part of the process.</p>
<p>“I wore black for six and half months,” said Sherry of her life right now, fluffy up her brightly patterned scarf. “At a certain point you just can&#8217;t do that anymore.”</p>

A Superior Court Judge ruled this week that Jack Halprin, a Google lawyer and Mission landlord, had failed to pay required relocation fees to a teacher, her partner and their son, who live in one of Halprin&#8217;s units at 812 Guerrero St., according to the court document signed on May 6.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Superior Court Judge ruled this week that Jack Halprin, a Google lawyer and Mission landlord, had failed to pay required relocation fees to a teacher, her partner and their son, who live in one of Halprin&#8217;s units at 812 Guerrero St., according to the court document signed on May 6.</p>
<p>The judgment, which will allow the tenants to stay for now,  affects one of several households Halprin has been trying to evict by using the Ellis Act to take units off the rental market.</p>
<p>Claudia Tirado, one of the tenants named in the lawsuit, wrote in an e-mail to Mission Local that Halprin can appeal this decision or start the process again. He could also elect to drop the idea of evicting the tenants. &#8220;We still are waiting for the court&#8217;s decision on the other tenants,&#8221; Tirado wrote.</p>
<p>The ruling on Wednesday found that Halprin failed to pay the first half of the relocation fee to Tirado, a teacher, and her partner, Alexandre Queres de Barros.  The ruling signed by Judge Ronald Evan Quidachay also said that Halprin failed to pay a relocation fee to Tirado&#8217;s son, Valentino.   The ruling was first <a href="http://www.beyondchron.org/ellis-eviction-by-google-attorney-stopped/">reported in Beyond Chron. </a></p>
<p>Tirado wrote in an e-mail that she had only heard from her attorney &#8220;that we won,&#8221; and she is still waiting for more details.</p>
<p>Tirado, who was represented by Stephen Collier and Joseph K. Barber from the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, has become an outspoken critic of the Ellis Act and its use by speculators who buy apartments at a bargain price because it has tenants under rent control, and then turn around and evict the tenants to take the building off the rental market.  Speculators often then sell the units at a much higher price per unit than they had paid.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t he buy a regular house, why does he have to take seven units off the rental market,” Tirado asked Mission Local at an <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2015/05/judge-rules-against-google-lawyer-in-eviction-case/">earlier protest in front of Halprin&#8217;s building. </a></p>
<p>Evan Wolkenstein, another teacher in the building, and several other tenants have also filed cases against Halprin, who purchased the building three years ago. &#8220;We still are waiting for the court&#8217;s decision on the other tenants,&#8221; Tirado said.</p>
<p>The lawyer and landlord filed Ellis Act evictions against all six tenants in February 2014.</p>
<p><em>We are updating this story as we get more information. Updated on May 9 to include an e-mail from Tirado. </em></p>

<p>Today’s Block: York to Hampshire, 26th to Cesar Chavez.</p>
<p>I want a party, which means I want a party for all of the amazing neighbors who have participated in documenting the Mission.  But, first we have to finish, so I got up Tuesday morning to document two blocks for the empty weekend spots. So yes, these photos were taken much earlier, but I doubt the block has changed much in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s striking at this end of the Mission is the number of homes done by the same builder/developer and the lovely lines that some of them have &#8211; especially seen unfold in a row.</p>
<p><em>With the light good early on, so much the better to sign on to document your block. Don’t wait! Let us know what day and block you would like at info@missionlocal.com.</em></p>
<p><em>You can see a map <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=ziIbbazU0RLI.kLEnS6MFxGWc">of all of the blocks here.</a> The blocks in grey are being saved for others who have signed up. Let us save a block for you as well.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>La renovación de Dolores Park se ha visto plagada de demoras y obstáculos imprevistos que incluyen vandalismo costoso. Pero nada se compara con lo que sucedió a mediados de febrero. El director del Recreation and Parks Department (<em>Departamento de Recreación y Parques</em>), Phil Ginsburg, informó en febrero que dos jóvenes vándalos (“dos idiotas”, como él los llamó) irrumpieron en el sitio de la construcción al extremo norte de Dolores Park, encendieron uno de los vehículos de construcción con los cables, marcaron con círculos el césped e hicieron acrobacias en pavimento sin curar.</p>
<p>El paseo no solo destruyó el césped, que aún no se había arraigado, sino que también dañó una parte de la infraestructura de drenaje recién instalada. Los vándalos también se metieron a una caseta de mantenimiento nueva  y prendieron una fogata para derretir bombones y preparar s’mores que habían traído con ellos.</p>
<p>Después del incidente, Ginsberg dijo que la policía arrestó a los dos vándalos. Uno de ellos era un menor y el otro no sobrepasaba los 18 años por mucho.</p>
<p>Ginsberg hizo los comentarios en una rueda de prensa el día 18 de febrero, aunque informó el <a href="http://wn.ktvu.com/story/28132951/vandalism-could-delay-reopening-portion-of-dolores-park">incidente a KTVU</a> el día anterior. El daño asciende a cerca de $100,000, los cuales serán cubiertos por la aseguradora del contratista o por el contratista mismo, dijo Jacob Gilchrist, el Director del Proyecto Dolores Park.</p>
<p>“Estos contratos tienen agendas muy complejas en cuanto a cuándo realizar el trabajo, y algo como lo que sucedió representa un gran problema para toda esa construcción,” dijo Gilchrist.</p>
<p>Antes del costoso paseo, el departamento de parques había planeado reinaugurar la parte norte del parque a mediados de abril. Sin embargo, el daño sustancial retrasó el proyecto por varias semanas, pues el césped deberá volver a ser plantado y requerirá tiempo para arraigarse. Gilchrist explicó que la renovación completa del parque, que se esperaba terminada para junio de 2015, ahora se espera en algún momento “al final del otoño.”</p>
<p>“Estamos construyendo un parque de veinte millones de dólares para ustedes, ¡solo disfrútenlo!” dijo Ginsberg.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to bring more affordable housing and an end to evictions in the Mission District, housing activists and residents from the Mission and other parts of the city are  gathering at City Hall today and rallying in support of a market rate housing moratorium.</p>
<p>With SFPD barricades in place on the steps of City Hall to narrow the entrance and exits to the building, activists were beginning to gather at around 11:00 a.m. for their noon rally. By 11:30, about 50 had arrived.</p>
<p>Activists  inside City Hall said they planned to go to each supervisor&#8217;s office individually and announce their demands. Mercy Jimenez, of Our Mission No Eviction, was among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Affordable housing is the main thing we&#8217;re demanding,&#8221; Jimenez says. &#8220;All this housing is coming in, and there&#8217;s no way to stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p>By noon the crowd of activists has grown to more than 200, including those outside and inside. They filed in to the city hall building, going through a security scan one by one.</p>
<p>Supervisor David Campos, coming from his office to meet the protesters, told newscasters that the Mission needs 2,400 new units of housing just to maintain the level of families in the Mission.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127298498?title=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The crowd gathered inside city hall launched into a series of chants. Oscar Grande, an activist with PODER, led them, shouting &#8220;Welcome to our house! It&#8217;s been bought and paid for! Whose house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our house!&#8221; the crowd shouted back at him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127301412" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>After singing a rendition of &#8220;This Little Light of Mine,&#8221; the group moved up the stairs and marched through the hall that leads to the doors of the supervisors&#8217; offices. As the gathering passed by Supervisor Jane Kim&#8217;s office, the District 6 supervisor and staffers were there to greet the protest with a sign showing their support. Kim, and a short way along the hall, Campos, shook hands and exchanged the occasional embrace with the steady stream of protesters that moved past them.</p>

They recited a list of demands, including that Lee ask owners of burnt buildings to provide the right to return to both businesses and residents, that homeless families be housed in empty units on Treasure Island and in the Presidio, and that 3000 units of new affordable housing be constructed. &#8220;Right now Mayor Lee, you are putting the budget for the city together and we demand that $150 million be put in budget for &#8230; affordable housing,&#8221; said activist Roberto Hernandez as the group echoed him, amplifying him as a human microphone. &#8220;With all the taxes that the city&#8217;s collecting right now, they should go to La Misión.&#8221; &#8220;Se ve, se siente, el pueblo esta presente,&#8221; the group chanted outside Lee&#8217;s door.</p>

<p><strong>2:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>It seemed the protesters were settling in for a long wait. Someone had ordered several pizzas for them, which were quickly distributed and eaten by activists who now sat, stood, or leaned in small groups around the atrium in front of Lee&#8217;s office doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all here because it&#8217;s unjust that just because of money, we&#8217;re getting pushed out,&#8221; said Sheila Hernandez, a Mission resident for 17 years who says she&#8217;s been evicted three times. &#8220;You start to feel powerless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ivy Jeanne, another Mission resident, has had her own close brushes with eviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a slumlord who is trying to find every excuse to evict us,&#8221; she said. She says those excuses have included trying to evict tenants by deciding a bike storage area could no longer be used as such, and by accusing them of withholding rent and then suddenly &#8220;finding&#8221; their rent checks. Jeanne was at the protest &#8220;to support my friends and the community that I&#8217;ve given to over the last 18 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her friend Laure, who declined to give her last name, said she used to live in a house in the Mission with two other mothers and their children. They dubbed it the &#8220;Mama House.&#8221; Their landlord kept their rent consistent for many years, but one year raised the rent the allowable percentage that had accrued.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t take the hit, so we left,&#8221; Laure said. Now, she lives in Mission Bay in an affordable unit, but struggles there because her rent can still rise incrementally, but her income does not keep pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here because I don&#8217;t want to live in a city that uses hygienic metaphors that make it okay to kick out disabled people, to kick out poor people, to kick out people of color,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Carlos Saez, a student at City College of San Francisco, lives with his parents in the Excelsior, but said their situation is no less precarious. Their home, which they purchased in the 80&#8217;s, is still under mortgage, and the payments are too much for his parents to handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;My folks work around the clock and they&#8217;re struggling to pay the bills. They&#8217;re looking at leaving the city,&#8221; Saez said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just his parents&#8217; generation that&#8217;s affected by a rising cost of living. His grandmother used to run a daycare in the Mission, but she was recently evicted from her building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have all our memories there, but it&#8217;s just not the same,&#8221; Saez said.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/missionlocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/carlos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291200" src="http://i1.wp.com/missionlocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/carlos.jpg?resize=640%2C427" alt="carlos" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Amy Farah Weiss, who is running for mayor, has also experienced displacement. Standing outside City Hall talking with other residents after most of those attending had departed, she said she has been displaced twice before landing in her current living space, a cooperative of seven people living in a single family home. She said she didn&#8217;t consider the days events a protest so much as &#8220;a marriage of democracy and action.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor did not make an appearance, and protesters departed, though they promised in a chorus: &#8220;We&#8217;ll be back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin Lindo, of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, called the action a &#8220;victory,&#8221; and said a representative from the Mayor&#8217;s office had come out to take a list of demands. As for the mayor&#8217;s absence, that wasn&#8217;t a drawback, Lindo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t for the mayor to see. This was for the city to see,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The city&#8217;s consciousness has been raised.&#8221;</p>
