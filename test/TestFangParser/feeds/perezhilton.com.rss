<p>But the performance is just phenomenal, with <strong>Holly Robinson Peete</strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/ricki-lake/" target="_blank">Ricki Lake</a></strong> belting it out, and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/patrick-dempsey/" target="_blank">Patrick Dempsey</a></strong> slaying some air monsters!</p>

<p>Looks like their long legal battle could be coming to an end… maybe.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/real-housewives/" target="_blank">Real Housewives of New Jersey</a></em></strong> stars <strong>Teresa</strong> and <strong>Joe Giudice</strong> are currently dealing with a 41-count indictment, because of their mail and wire fraud conspiracy, but they may make it out of this without having to do tons of jail time.</p>
<p>Actually, Teresa may not have to do any!</p>
<p>Joe <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2014-01-23-teresa-giudice-joe-giudice-fraud-court-separate-trial#sthash.ijf0tcb9.dpbs" target="_blank">previously</a> took the blame for what happened, but both parties will suffer some kind of punishment in the plea deal they’ve offered the U.S. Attorney’s office.</p>
<p>In this deal, Joe will get locked up for at least five years, and Teresa will stay out of jail, but serve a max of five years probation. In addition, they’ll pay $11 million in restitution.</p>
<p>Sounds kind of short for two people facing 50 years, no?</p>
<p>But these two have kids to think of, so at least having Teresa home allows them to grow up with one of their parents.</p>
<p>Teresa and Joe will hear back on Tuesday whether or not the U.S. Attorney will take their <a href="http://perez.ly/1dMGZFw" target="_blank">deal</a>.</p>
