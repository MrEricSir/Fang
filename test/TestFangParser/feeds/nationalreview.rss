    <title>More on TNR</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Over at Slate, Rutgers prof and former TNR managing editor David Greenburg has a fine piece, "What We Lost with the Loss of The New Republic." We lost a place for what he calls "heterodox liberalism." RTW--I largely agree with his take, and particularly so with this bit:The impending transformation of the New Republic from a liberal magazine into a “vertically integrated digital media company” is regrettable for many reasons, not all of them sentimental. Conservatives need a liberal magazine that’s unpredictable enough to make them want to read it. Liberals and leftists need a magazine that will prod <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/postmodern-conservative/394135/more-tnr-carl-eric-scott">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>Zerlina Maxwell Will Believe Anything</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Zerlina Maxwell -- a lawyer last seen making the fully commonsense case that if John Cusack is outside your home with the sleeves of his eighties coat rolled up and holding a loud boombox over his head, he is to be taken down by main force -- throws caution to the wind in praising Sabrina Rubin Erdely's University of Virginia rape story, which has now been orphaned by Rolling Stone.The story of J, Maxwell writes in the Washington Post, "helped dramatize what happens when the claims of victims are not taken seriously." Maxwell also flirts with libel in asserted that <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394134/zerlina-maxwell-will-believe-anything-tim-cavanaugh">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>Hillary Clinton: Failed Co-President</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton has plenty of White House experience. Unfortunately, it’s experience at mucking things up. Or, as The New York Times puts it in today’s long profile, “Clinton’s History as First Lady: Powerful but Not Always Deft.” There’s lots of juicy material in the Times piece, yet very little that’s new—the dramatic opening anecdote included. The Times profile is based on recently released oral histories of the Clinton presidency, but memoirs and investigative biographies have largely covered the same ground.That is not to say that today’s profile is unimportant. On the contrary, the public has never fully digested <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394132/hillary-clinton-failed-co-president-stanley-kurtz">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>It's a Kevorkian World</title>
        <description><![CDATA[In the midst of the Brittany Maynard media mania, it struck me how prophetic Jack Kevorkian was about how deeply the culture of death would subsume the culture of the West. So, I took to the pages of the Weekly Standard to issue a storm warming. From, "Kevorkian's Vision:"The last time the media swarmed so feverishly in favor of assisted suicide was when they touted Jack Kevorkian’s defiant assisted suicide campaign in the 1990s. As they later would with Maynard, the media substituted intense emotionalism for reporting and analysis, focusing almost exclusively on the suffering of those who wanted to <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/394130/its-kevorkian-world-wesley-j-smith">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

More than 100 Luftwaffe bombers mounted a surprise attack on Allied ships moored in the harbor. Their bombs sank or rendered inoperable 28 of these ships. Nearly a thousand Allied troops were killed or wounded. along with hundreds of civilians.Unbeknownst to those in the port, one of the ships carried liquid death in its belly.

As a rule, the rich and mighty are well known but loved sparingly; every once in a while, though, you can get genuinely torn up by a famous stranger’s death. For people of a certain age, there was John Lennon. For people of a certain taste, there was Michael Jackson. For me, there was Michael Crichton, who died six years ago, when I was a freshman undergrad.#ad#Like many Crichton fans, I was hooked by Jurassic Park.

Like its health-care “reform” campaign, the Obama Left’s civil-rights crusade is about control -- central control of state law enforcement by Washington.The deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York are each tragic in their own way. But in neither is there a federal civil-rights case to be had.

    <title>Liberalism Is a Hoax</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Talk about a dramatic entrance. When the St. Louis Rams took the field last Sunday, several teammates raised their hands, palms out. It was an act of solidarity with Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed last August in a struggle with a white police officer. Moments before his demise, it is said, Brown raised his hands and pleaded: “Don’t shoot.”Since then “hands up, don’t shoot” has become the rallying cry of protesters and rioters furious that the officer, Darren Wilson, was not indicted by a grand jury. There is just one problem: It is not clear that Brown put <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/article/394108/liberalism-hoax-matthew-continetti">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>Wild: Movies in a Hopeless Place</title>

Most new films are so clumsily yet predictably constructed (whether Boyhood or Gone Girl) they cannot produce the emotional coherence remembered from solid, classically made films. This clumsiness-bordering-on-ineptitude seriously impairs the new Reese Witherspoon movie Wild.Director Jean Marc Vallee who made last year’s Dallas Buyer’s Club and novelist-turned-screenwriter Nick Hornby adapt Cheryl Strayed’s 2012 autobiography Wild, which described her journey through grief, drugs, and sex -- a downward spiral turned into an uplifted metaphor of healing.

The apology followed several days of increasing doubts expressed in the media about the veracity of "Jackie," the woman described in the story. Rolling Stone's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, in part:In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.

However, it is important to note that this video is one of a colorful collection of Hillary music videos lovingly produced by her supporters over the years.

        <description><![CDATA[Senator-elect Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) tried to jumpstart a phone-banking campaign against the funding measure that House leadership is expected put on the floor next week, saying that lawmakers might change course of voters break the Capitol switchboard.“In 2007, there were reports that the Capitol switch board actually stopped working because so many people called, and asked their senators and congressmen to stop an amnesty bill going through at the time, and it stopped," Cotton told Laura Ingraham on Friday. "And it helped in 2013 when the House was on the verge of considering something like the Gang of Eight <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394103/tom-cotton-break-capitol-phone-switchboard-fight-obamas-amnesty-joel-gehrke">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>"This Will Revolutionize Education"</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Oh, really? Whether it was the motion picture, radio, computer, or now the Internet, technological advancement has always been followed by that prediction. But maybe the way information is delivered is not as important as the environment in which it is delivered. Maybe learning is a social process, a process that works best with engaged teachers who inspire and demand much from their students. These and related ideas are discussed in this new video from Veritasium, an educational science channel on YouTube:]]></description>

    <title>Michael Brown Protesters Have Shut Down More Traffic Than Chris Christie</title>
        <description><![CDATA[While New Jersey governor Chris Christie has been apparently cleared by a Democratic investigation of the September 2013 closing of lanes on the George Washington Bridge, America's white-line nightmare continues.But, miraculously, the illegal closing of major highways and bridges by protesters from Southern California to New York City has so far failed to generate a rash of news stories about stalled ambulances, stranded seniors, and schoolchildren whose dreams of betterment were dashed by delayed school buses. If it weren't for Tyree Landrum, the heroic San Diego County commuter widely described as "angry driver" in media reports after he objected to <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/article/394100/michael-brown-protesters-have-shut-down-more-traffic-chris-christie-tim-cavanaugh">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>Jindal: Congress Should 'Absolutely' Defund Obama's Immigration Order</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Governor Bobby Jindal is "extremely disappointed" in Republican members of Congress for not using the power of the purse to stop President Obama's recent executive action on immigration.During an interview on Laura Ingraham's radio show on Friday, the Louisiana Republican and potential 2016 hopeful encouraged his state's delegation, as well as others, to be willing to move forward with that strategy if need be. "I’ve said this publicly and will absolutely continue to say it: We need to use every tool we can in Congress -- as well as the state level -- to force the president to follow the <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394094/jindal-congress-should-absolutely-defund-obamas-immigration-order-andrew-johnson">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>Rolling Stone and Its Objection to a Cultural Mix of Sex and Violence</title>

    <title>Rolling Stone, Rape Apologists</title>
        <description><![CDATA[It is with a heavy heart and a furrowed brow that I must conclude this afternoon that Rolling Stone, once a venerated pop-culture institution, is a rape-apology website. A few hours ago, in a “note to our readers,” the magazine cast aspersions on its own story about an alleged rape at the University of Virginia, doing a disservice to women everywhere and buying into an anti-female, denialist agenda that needs smashing from the ground up. As students of feminism know, any institution that would question the testimony of a young woman is by definition buying into a culture of “skepticism” <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/article/394095/rolling-stone-rape-apologists-charles-c-w-cooke">Read More</a> ...]]></description>

    <title>The New Republic, 1914-2014</title>
        <description><![CDATA[Alas, it looks like it’s over for The New Republic magazine. A once-great institution, killed by a pair of lofo-pandering facebook-enriched millennial jerks. I here voice my gratitude to all of those who made the magazine central to my political education in the 1990s. I wouldn’t be who I am today were it not for TNR. I stopped my subscription sometime in 2008, and had stopped eagerly reading the magazine around 2005 or so. And not too long ago, when I had thought about re-subscribing, I found myself dissuaded by articles like the one that stooped to <br><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/postmodern-conservative/394093/new-republic-1914-2014-carl-eric-scott">Read More</a> ...]]></description>
