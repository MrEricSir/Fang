  <div>It's a fun weekend ahead in the Lower Haight, with art, music, dogs, sports, and more. Here's what you need to know.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>Tonight, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Underground SF</span> (424 Haight) hosts its usual Thursday night party known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/717303204993193/" target="_blank">Bubble</a>. From 10pm to 2am, enjoy house and techno music from DJs Mike Frugaletti, Jeffrey Felch, and Joel Conway. It's 21+ and there's no cover.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>On Friday night, be sure to swing by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fifty24SF</span> (218 Fillmore) for the opening of "Thésis" by Mexican artist Jesús Benítez. The show will feature 27 mixed media pieces and a mural by Benítez – you can check out our <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/07/preview-jesus-benitez-at-fifty24sf" target="_blank">preview</a> here. Friday's opening starts at 7pm.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>On Saturday from 10am to noon, head to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duboce Park</span> for the monthly Friends of Duboce Park volunteer day. Supplies, tools, and gloves will be provided to help you clean up and beautify the park. Meet by the Rec Center, and stay as long as you're able.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Then, mosey over to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zerofriends</span> (419 Haight) for the signing of a new 188-page book featuring the work of 14 different artists. Nine of them, including Alex Pardee and Dave Correia, will be on hand to sign copies, and books will be available for sale for $30 plus tax. The event happens from 2pm to 4pm, and you can get more info <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/597755850323151" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>On Sunday at noon, it's the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/07/party-for-three-legged-dogs-in-duboce-park-sunday" target="_blank">Three-Legged Dog Party</a></span> in Duboce Park.  It's not <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> for three-legged dogs, mind you, but any dogs with special physical conditions. It's BYO-everything, so pack a picnic and a pooch and prepare to party until 3pm. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>And finally, Sunday at noon is <span style="font-style: italic;">also</span> the start of that little sporting event known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">World Cup</span> final match. Expect the neighborhood bars to be packed 'n' rowdy; partake or avoid accordingly.</div>

  <p>This Friday at 7pm, The Mill will be host a record release party for a new album by <a href="http://www.sandysband.com/" target="_blank">Sandy’s</a> , a psychedelic surf-pop group based here in the Bay Area. The event will feature free nachos by Josey Baker (featuring 4505 pork), beer by donation and, of course, plenty music.</p>
  <div>Curious, we caught up with Sandy’s frontman Alexi Glickman to learn a bit more about the rockers about to descend on the neighborhood. Although the latest album, Fourth Dementia, was performed for the most part by Glickman himself, the touring group also includes Nick Aives (<a href="http://therangeoflightwilderness.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">The Range of Light Wilderness</a>), Burton Li (<a href="https://myspace.com/thebotticellis" target="_blank">The Botticellis</a>) and Jeremy Black (<a href="http://cargocollective.com/ApolloSunshine" target="_blank">Apollo Sunshine</a>).</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us a little about yourself and your band.</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"For the two or three years I’ve lived on Mount Tam. My nickname is Sandy and I started performing as Sandy’s with a revolving cast of characters but usually just a drummer and me. It evolved into a full band in the last year. Most of the album was actually recorded in living rooms and bedrooms in the Sunset."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">How would you describe your sound? What’s your music all about?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"That’s a hard question…it’s always hard for someone to describe their own music. If I had to give you the short answer, I would say that it sounds like trying to stuff a classical piece into a three-minute pop song."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you choose The Mill to host your record release party?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"Probably because we played a Halloween show there and it was really fun. Everyone got fed really well and it felt more like playing a house party than a bar. Also, our bass player Nicky works there."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Where are your favorite places to eat on Divis?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"I actually always lived in The Sunset, so I haven’t really spent much time here. I guess I’d say the food backstage at The Independent. They always have really nice hummus and celery and carrots and stuff."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">When did you play The Independent?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"The last time we played there was December. With Sandy’s, I’ve played The Independent three times and in my old group, The Botticellis, played there a number of times. It’s my favorite place to play in SF."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"They treat you really nice and it sounds really good. What more could you ask for?"</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your favorite beachside cocktail?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"Blended kale with a splash of Martinellis."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">What about this new record makes you most excited?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"It’s always nice when a musical project gets put out on vinyl. This was really a labor of love in the studio and when you get listen to it analog it makes it that much nicer."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">What’s next for Sandy’s?</span>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>"Right now we’re on tour that finishes up Sunday in St. Helena, outside of Santa Rosa. Afterwards, we’ll go back to the studio as a band and make the next record with the sound created by the four of us. We’re all looking forward to that."</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>Intrigued?  You can stream the <a href=" http://sandys.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">new album here</a> or check them out this Friday at The Mill. Copies of the LP will be available for signing and the event will also feature a short skate film entitled Cuatro Sueños Pequenos by Thomas Campbell and a DJ set by Tmoeski.</div>

  <p>The Great Goodwill Remodel of 2014 is about at its halfway point, so we thought we'd check in on the progress and get a tour of the new space. </p>
  <div>As a reminder, they're still taking donations, and they still have about a third of the space selling clothes and housewares. The two-thirds of the space that's been under construction is cordoned off with black plastic. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>

  <div>

    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Behind the curtain, they've got fresh paint, new floors, and an upgraded ceiling:</div>

    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Possibly most exciting of all, the new Goodwill has a sleek new counter near the door where the future registers will go. So long, weird register box where you can never tell where the line is supposed to be!</div>
  <div>
    <br/>

    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The employee we spoke to said it'll be another two weeks or more until everything is completed. So far, lookin' good. If you have a chance to peek in next time you're near Haight &amp;amp; Cole, it's strangely transcendent to stare into the huge, clean, empty space that used to comprise the bulk of their sales floor. We highly recommend it. </div>

  <p>While the removal of the Central Freeway in the late 90s and early 2000s brought many positive changes to Hayes Valley, the neighborhood still serves as a central artery for getting into and across the city.</p>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Due to the heavy amount of car, pedestrian, and bike traffic, we want to highlight five intersections in the neighborhood we feel are either dangerous, difficult to cross as a pedestrian or biker, or notable due to their strange traffic patterns.  </span>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">For example, Octavia Blvd is bumper-to-bumper during rush hour commutes. As a result, Haight, Page, Fell, and Oak streets all see cars backed up for several blocks while people wait to merge on and reach the freeway entrance. </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Crossing Octavia in the morning as a biker or pedestrian can be a timing challenge as well. Unless you're at the corner of Page Street ready to go, pedestrians can barely walk across Octavia in enough time.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Cars, pedestrians, and bikers are all faced with a mix of one-way streets (some of which suddenly become two-way), along with intersections that only have three out of the usual four crosswalks. </span>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">We often see people forced to take all three crosswalks to traverse from one side of Franklin and Fell to the other, for example. </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">And as </span>
      <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/07/petition-created-to-add-speed-bumps-along-patricias-green" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">we shared</a>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> earlier this week, a petition has been created on change.org to install speed bumps  near Patricia's Green, as many fear that people or pets could get injured at any time due to speeding traffic. </span>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>With that said, check out the five intersections we've highlighted below and let us know what you think in the comments afterwards. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MARKET &amp;amp; OCTAVIA</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xkxglFOMxyI/U737i3tGAuI/AAAAAAAAB-g/218TyWZWJ5E/w1097-h823-no/photo+copy.JPG" style="width: 595px;"/>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>As the <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/camera-installed-to-address-safety-at-dangerous-market-and-octavia-intersection/Content?oid=2609490" target="_blank">SFExaminer</a> pointed out last October and SFMTA <a href="https://www.baycitizen.org/documents/sf-accident-report/" target="_blank">shared</a> in a report in 2012, this is often considered the most dangerous intersection in San Francisco. Between 2009-2011, there were 30 injury collisions at this intersection, several of which involved fatalities. And out of the 13 injury collisions in 2011, nine were vehicle/bicycle collisions. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>What's causing the problem? Well, cars can't turn right onto the Central Freeway from Market (but people still attempt it). <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Bikes riding on Market crossing Octavia do so alongside cars and have to dodge ones that either brake late or run the red light. Bikes riding on Octavia crossing Market can utilize side lanes and alleys on both sides of the intersection. </span></div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>As of 2012, pedestrians now have giant painted crosswalks with time signals, but still often have to dodge cars (and sometimes bikes) that run through the lights. </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MARKET, FRANKLIN &amp;amp; PAGE</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bM6PeuQ4vQk/U737fvZikgI/AAAAAAAAB-E/sViPOTXMijo/w1097-h823-no/photo+%25281%2529.JPG" style="width: 595px;"/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>This complicated intersection brings a few major streets in our neighborhood to a traffic standstill. Cars wanting to head north on Franklin often underestimate the time they have to turn left from Market and get stuck in the middle of the intersection while pedestrians from Page try to cross Franklin and end up walking between cars in gridlock. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>Pedestrians walking on Market deal with two separately timed signals. If you're walking north, the lights work in your favor and you can get all the way across. If you're walking south, you'll often get stuck in the small triangle for a few minutes until you can move again. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>In addition, many bike riders use Page to get to Market and often compete for space with backed up cars (and the 6 and 71 buses) while they wait to turn left. </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br/>

      </span>
    </div>
    <div>We're cheating a little and grouping these together because they have similar traffic patterns. Both Fell and Hayes are major streets in Hayes Valley with a huge amount of car traffic. Both have parts that are one-way only. And both intersections don't have signals for pedestrians crossing Van Ness, so people walking across Van Ness are left guessing how long they have until the traffic signal turns red. </div>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>There are a few things that made us want to discuss this intersection. To start with, walking on Hayes Street across Gough on the north side (from Absinthe to Chez Maman) is often met with a surprise when you step down and realize how high the curb is from the pavement (not as high as the one outside Suppenküche, though). </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>There are handicap-accessible ramps to get from Absinthe to Caffe Delle Stelle, but not to go from Absinthe to Chez Maman. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>And unlike other intersections in the neighborhood where cars get a left-turn signal during the last 5-10 seconds of a stop light, cars get to turn left onto Gough at the beginning of the light, before people can cross the street. Pedestrians are often found jetting into the intersection before realizing they're about to get hit.</div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OAK &amp;amp; OCTAVIA</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uk0SSBiqYgw/U737i7tqdgI/AAAAAAAAB-c/bxR6TmkReqw/w1097-h823-no/photo+%25285%2529.JPG" style="width: 595px;"/>

      </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Getting onto Octavia from Oak involves cars backed up for several blocks in the right lane. Those who try to cut in at the last second create further problems and get honked at by everyone who either queued properly or is trying to go straight on Oak.</span>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>Walking on Oak across Octavia involves two different pedestrian light signals and four sections of lanes. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>In addition, cars driving north on the central part of Octavia sometimes attempt to turn right onto Oak (or move into the right side lane of Octavia) without paying attention to people, bikes, or cars moving forward in that same lane. When we stood out here last night, we saw a car almost hit a biker doing that exact thing. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>************</div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>As we mentioned above, we wanted to highlight five intersections that immediately came to our minds. This list is by no means meant to be exclusive. And we also recognize that it's tough to navigate these streets as drivers, pedestrians <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> bikers. </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>We'd love to hear if you agree with the ones we discussed or would suggest different intersections to be included. If you have any horror stories from driving, biking, or walking across any of these intersections, please share them in the comments below. </div>

  <div>Jesús Benítez, Mexican street artist and illustrator, will be having his first North American show opening at <a href="http://www.fifty24sf.com" target="_blank">Fifty24SF</a> gallery this Friday, July 11th.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>

    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Starting at 7pm, you can bring your own drinks to the free show at the Fillmore Street gallery and see Benítez’s variety of mixed media pieces, which he’s been working on for the past four months.<div><br/></div><div>The title of his collection, ‘Thésis,’ is based on a school thesis, or dissertation. "The show is about my life inspired by sci-fi books," explained the artist, who has been painting since he was 13 years old.</div><div><br/></div><div>Friday’s show will be the first time Benítez uses his full name instead of his street moniker, <a href="http://dhear.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Dhear</a>.  In fact, he’s so secretive about his identity, he wouldn't allow us to take any photos of him – only of his artwork. </div><div><br/></div><div>The pieces we saw were mostly acrylic paintings with inspiration ranging from a personified version of his cat, to a tribute to War of the Worlds, to a variety of microscopic creatures. The full show will feature about 27 pieces and a large mural taking up an entire wall of the gallery.  </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZC1g58R3JHU/U71QRdppfvI/AAAAAAAAXiM/URLy1FBCB0s/thesis3.jpg?imgmax=1600" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; width: 594px;"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Gp900CK_cRg/U71QRbIF2WI/AAAAAAAAXiU/LjPk8xP0-tI/thesis1.jpg?imgmax=1600" style="width: 594px;"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OYCFbwfwYmQ/U71RXs-HixI/AAAAAAAAXik/n70h3fpibi0/thesis4.jpg?imgmax=1600" style="width: 594px;"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>As for his thoughts on San Francisco, the Mexico City-based artist had this to say: “It’s my first time, I love it... love the houses and the people."</div></div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>If you can't make it on Friday, the show runs until August 31, and you can find more information on Fifty24SF's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/706329862748953/" target="_blank">event page</a>.

  <p>Tikka Masala has gone on and off the market several times in the protracted <a href="https://hoodline.com/2013/09/the-end-of-tikki-masala" target="_blank">on-again</a>, <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/04/tikka-masala-closed-again" target="_blank">off-again</a> saga that has plagued the restaurant. As you might recall, it closed its doors for over a year following a building fire three years ago, and its openings and closings have made it an object of speculation since then. </p>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Now, though <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/04/tikka-masala-closed-again" target="_blank">purportedly</a> "closed for renovations," it's up for sale again.</span>
    <div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
          <br/>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">The business, located at 1668 Haight Street, is listed by Jodi Real Estate Group. According to Brandon Chen, a realtor at Jodi, the spot is going for the nifty price of $99,000, which includes the restaurant's equipment.</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
          <br/>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">That price is about $80k less than the price listed last fall, around the time that Great Indian Food <a href="http://hoodline.com/2013/07/hey-there-great-indian-food" target="_blank">came to the street</a>, and it's a big cut from back in July of last year, <a href="http://www.trulia.com/property/3125622527-1668-Haight-St-San-Francisco-CA-94117" target="_blank">when it was listed for $200k</a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
          <br/>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">It also does not include the restaurant's name, which might not be such a bad thing considering Tikka Masala's mixed reputation.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>So if you've got a cool $100k, a Big Plan and an idea for a restaurant on the street, now's your chance to make your move. </div>

  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">The neighborhood is mostly plagued by the city-wide issues of car break-ins and theft, but yesterday, two crimes were reported to SFPD that warrant a closer look.</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Shortly after 10pm on June 8th, a man was mugged at gunpoint on the corner of Fulton and Pierce, on the north side of Alamo Square. The male suspect held up the victim at gunpoint and asked for his wallet. Once determining there was no cash in the wallet, the suspect threw it back at the victim and left the scene.  </span>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>A "hot prowl" (SFPD's terminology) also occurred yesterday on the 1200 block of Fell Street. A man was awoken by a noise from his bathroom shortly after noon. When he attempted to enter the bathroom, the intruder blocked the door. The victim shouted that the police were on their way. He managed to pry the bathroom door open, but the intruder had left through an open window. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>As always, stay safe neighbors! If you have any particular concerns about crime in the neighborhood, feel free to bring them to the next North of the Panhandle Neighborhood Association Meeting on July 17th (details coming soon). You can also contact Leela {at} nopna {dot} org if you'd like to join the <a href="http://wp.nopna.org/resources/safety/" target="_blank">NOPNA Safety Group</a>. </div>

  <p>One year ago, we first <a href="http://hoodline.com/2013/07/waiting-for-monsieur-benjamin" target="_blank">shared</a> that Corey Lee, chef-owner of <a href="http://www.benusf.com/" target="_blank">Benu</a>, would be opening a new restaurant in Hayes Valley. That day has finally come. Today, he and his team are  opening the doors to <a href="http://monsieurbenjamin.com/" target="_blank">Monsieur Benjamin</a>, and everyone's invited to check it out. </p>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Located at the corner of Gough and Ivy, on the ground floor of the new(ish) 300 Ivy residential building, </span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Monsieur</span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> Benjamin is self-described as a "modern French bistro" that will serve as one of the few late-night dining options in the neighborhood. </span>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">When <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/03/chef-corey-lee-tells-us-about-monsieur-benjamin" target="_blank">we spoke to Lee in March</a>, he said we could expect items like steak tartare (served with a silky egg yolk puree and thin sheets of anchovy and caramelized onion) and hazelnut ice cream with banana buttercream on the menu. But now we know exactly what the restaurant will be offering. </span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div><a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/files/2014/07/MBDinner.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a copy of the menu</a> that lists all the drinks, appetizers, oysters, main courses, cheeses and desserts. As <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/07/08/corey-lees-monsieur-benjamin-opens-tomorrow-in-hayes-valley/" target="_blank">SFGate</a> points out, the menu is "very big, clocking in at over 40 dishes scattered over five categories."</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">The chef, Jason Berthold, formerly worked with Corey Lee when they both were at the The French Laundry (along with Charles Bililies, owner of <a href="http://souvlasf.com/" target="_blank">Souvla</a>). According to SFGate, everyone in he kitchen has previously worked together, and the team has been creating their menu for the past year.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="">The space was designed by <a href="http://www.aidlindarlingdesign.com/public.html" target="_blank">Aidlin Darling</a>, the same firm that did Bar Agricole in SoMa and the office space for Chronicle Books. The restaurant has 110 seats, and while you'll be able to make a reservation, they plan on saving half of those for walk-ins. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>"In addition to just being excited to be open, period, and in such a great neighborhood, we are looking forward to bringing late night dining to Hayes Valley," said Carey Snowden, who handles PR for Benu and Monsieur Benjamin. "In a few weeks, we'll have our outdoor dining and brunch going, which we're excited about too."</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">Beginning today, Monsieur Benjamin is open 5pm to 1am every night for dinner. They plan on opening for weekend lunch/brunch starting later this month. </div>

  <p>The city is working hard this year to improve our oft-delayed Muni system, and next up on the agenda is the 5-Fulton. Changes are on the way for the bus line, and you can learn more about it at a July 17th* <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/5_MuniForward_flyer.pdf" target="_blank">community meeting</a> at the African American Art and Culture Complex. </p>
  <div>The city says staff will be on hand to discuss with anyone interested in an open-house format. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The route is currently popular, and slow. According to the SFMTA, the 5 carries over 19,000 passengers a day along its 5.6 mile route, and travels at an average speed of 9.6 miles per hour during peak commuting hours.</div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div>Here's what's on the agenda for the meeting:<div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li>Replacing all-way STOP-controlled intersections with traffic signals or traffic calming measures at nine intersections
<br/></li><li>Modifying transit stop locations
<br/></li><li>Adding pedestrian bulbs or refuge islands on Fulton at Ashbury, Clayton, and Cole</li></ul><div>Below is a draft of "travel time reduction" plans, which include significant changes to current bus shelters for both pedestrian safety and speed efficiency. You can read the full proposal of changes to the 5 line  <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/projects-planning/projects/muni-forward-5-fulton-rapid-proposal" target="_blank">here</a>. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_RxIF9L2FRQ/U7wwm0cenHI/AAAAAAAAXh4/DAIxaomu08I/w960-h745-no/5+Fulton.jpg.jpg" style="width: 595px;"/><br/></div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(Image: <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/projects/5%20Fulton%20120827.pdf" target="_blank">SFMTA</a>)</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Rethinking the 5 is all part of Muni's "Rapid Network," plan, which is aiming to improve the timeliness, safety and reliability of San Francisco's city transportation. Community meetings are being held around the city to gain feedback from residents and commuters. Already discussed were <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/06/open-house-monday-for-71-haight-muni-improvements" target="_blank">changes to the 71-Haight</a> in a meeting last month, as well as<a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/02/changes-to-local-muni-service" target="_blank"> proposed moderations to the 6-Parnassus line</a> earlier this year. </div></div></div><div><br/></div><div>The meeting will be held at 762 Fulton Street on Wednesday, July 9th from 6pm-7:30pm. <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Can't make the meeting in person, but still want your voice to be heard?

The link we included still says July 9th, but a person with the city said this is because a site glitch is preventing the update appearing.

  <div>For months, the Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council (HANC), Haight Ashbury Merchants Association, North Panhandle Neighborhood Association (NoPNA) and Friends of Buena Vista Park <a href="https://hoodline.com/2014/02/petition-to-improve-buena-vista" target="_blank">have been lobbying</a> London Breed's office to secure funding to improve both portions of Buena Vista Park and the pedestrian path in the southern portion of the Panhandle. Now, it seems they have succeeded. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The latest edition of HANC's newsletter <a href="http://www.hanc-sf.org/newsflash/600000-secured-for-two-neighborhood-parks.html" target="_blank">reports </a>that back in April, HANC put forward a request to Rec and Park for $1.1 million to rebuild the paths in the Panhandle and implement a tree maintenance program at Buena Vista. Breed was all over the plan for the Panhandle, but had to pull in Supervisor Scott Wiener for the plan for Buena Vista, since it's technically in his district.   </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>From there, the conversation shifted to include increased police presence in the park. The resulting funding looks like this: </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Buena Vista Park: $1 million for police presence, $100,000 for tree maintenance<br/></li>
      <li>Panhandle: $500,000 to be doled out over the next two years, $250,000 each year <br/></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>We reached out to Michelle Welch, who clarified that $1 million in police presence is to be spread around parks all over the city. But even a fraction <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">could go a long way towards reducing the crime in and around Buena Vista Park (examples </span><a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/03/poor-buena-vista" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">here</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> and </span><a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/04/crime-blotter-theft-in-the-upper-haight" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">here</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">), but it remains to be seen whether $100,000 will be enough to address some of the other problems BVP has faced, including litter removal, engaging new volunteers to help with upkeep, reducing fire hazards, and managing vegetation, all of which were concerns brought up by Isabel Wade of Friends of Buena Vista Park </span><a href="https://hoodline.com/2014/02/petition-to-improve-buena-vista" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">back in February</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">. Last month, Wade told SFGate that she </span><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/The-Haight-s-Buena-Vista-Park-needs-some-love-5546111.php" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">prefers to stay out of the park</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> after heavy rains, when branches are likely to fall. </span></div>

  <p>Remember the 7-Haight streetcar? Okay, probably not.</p>
  <div>But as you might know, the 7-Haight was the now-defunct, lately-a-bus line servicing the eastern end of Golden Gate Park. The street car operated from 1882 until this week 66 years ago, in 1948. Bus service on the 7 finally ended in 2010.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Trying to picture a streetcar trundling up Haight? The shot below was taken in 1948, the year the trolley service closed, and captures a streetcar passing the Haight theater going westbound at the corner of Haight and Cole (looking northeast). </div>

  </div>
  <div>It's been 66 years since the streetcar stopped service, and four since the 7-Haight Muni line disappeared. Now, <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/06/open-house-monday-for-71-haight-muni-improvements" target="_blank">changes could be on the way</a> for the 71-Haight and its "less than optimal speeds during peak periods."</div>
  <div>

  <div>After laying fallow for several months, <a href="http://www.hoodline.com/2014/05/magpie-rye-retail-space-up-for-rent" target="_blank">the space formally occupied by Magpie and Rye</a> has a new tenant, and he'll be serving coffee.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>We caught up with soon-to-be java slinger James Grogan to get some more details about Divisadero's next caffeination station. </div>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></span></div>Where are you from originally? Tell us a little about yourself.</span>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>"I grew up in Sonoma County and moved to San Francisco from Sebastopol a few years ago. I currently live in Noe Valley. I'm sort of a jack-of-all-trades. My degree is in computer science, I spent many years in IT and Operations, and I'm also a watercolor artist. My father and brother are both general contractors so I have a lot of construction experience. I moved to San Francisco to help open an age management medical office in the Financial District."</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is this your first coffee shop? What made you decide to open one on Divis?</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>"Yes, this is my first coffee shop. I have always wanted to open a coffee shop/art gallery. I love great coffee and was a weekend docent at the Sebastopol Center for the Arts and always wanted to own a small gallery. I picked Divisadero because it has a local community vibe and is up and coming."  </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are some details about what your space will feature? Will the coffee shop serve as a gallery space? </span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>"I'm using Sagan Piechota Architecture to help me design the space. My vision is serving great coffee and hanging fine art from local artists, preferably students.  I have spent some time at the Academy of Art and Sadie Valeri’s Atelier. I noticed a lot of student work that is pretty amazing. These are the artists I would like to feature."</div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">What kind of coffee will you be serving? Will there be food, beer and wine as well?</span>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
        <br/>
      </span>
    </div>
    <div>"I will be serving Ritual. I've been spending a lot of time talking with Eileen Rinaldi and Daria Whalen at Ritual Roasters. I love love love their coffee. I frequent the Flora Grubb location and that’s how I was introduced to Ritual. Our drinks will be mainly espresso, batch brew and pour over. We will not be serving alcohol and we will not be cooking at this location. For food I m in negotiations with <a href="http://www.sweetmue.com/" target="_blank">Sweetmue</a>. They offer classic French pastries that are Asian-inspired. We're coming up with something special only served on Saturdays."</div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's your philosophy as a coffee shop owner?</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>"I always think about what I like when I go to a coffee bar. We want to be acknowledged and feel important when we walk through the front door. Next is the product. The coffee needs to be great every time. That’s what makes me come back.  So if you really think about it, your staff is the key.  They need to be friendly and good at what they do."</div>
    <div>
      <br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When will construction begin and when do you estimate you will be open? </span>
    </div>
    <div>

Specifically, we're talking about cars as they drive down Octavia Boulevard.</span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Yesterday we came across a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/city-of-san-francisco-sfmtathe-san-francisco-municipal-transportation-agency-sfmta-installation-of-speed-bumps-on-both-sides-of-octavia-boulevard-extensions-running-along-patricia-s-green#intro" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">petition</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> on change.org entitled "Installation of speed bumps on both sides of Octavia Boulevard extensions running along Patricia's Green." </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Created by local resident Brian Wickersham, the goal of the movement is to get <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/" target="_blank">SFMTA</a> to add several speed bumps on Octavia Boulevard (on each side of Patricia's Green) between Hayes and Fell Streets.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>According to the petition, it all comes down to safety:</div><div><br/></div><blockquote>Daily I see near misses with pedestrians, bicyclists, people walking their pets, and even strollers. Car after car enters this street at a high speed as an extension of the freeway off ramp coming from Market St. Around 5 pm to 7pm, there are multiple vehicles that race down to Hayes St. It is only a matter of time before a person is killed or hit.</blockquote><div>We spoke to Brian, founding member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/130148740416094/" target="_blank">Hayes Valley Dog Buddies Group</a> on Facebook, who said he's already seen animals get hit by cars speeding by Patricia's Green. </div><div><br/></div><div>"I personally have already seen three dogs get <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">hit by cars at the park," Brian told us. "All were okay ... but terrifying moments not only for </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">the owners but the drivers who were flying down the street."</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Brian took on the endeavor because of his love for Patricia's Green and his hope to prevent a possible fatality before it actually happens. He says he wrote to the Parks and Recreation Department about this issue last year. He was told they were doing a "traffic flow" study but hasn't heard back since then.</div><div><br/></div><div>"I am simply a person who <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">loves 'the green', wants it to be safe, clean, and shared by all. I want </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">to prevent a death or major accident/injury before it's too late," he stated. </span></div><div><br/></div><div>The petition hopes to get 1,000 signatures of support and has collected 56 so far (as of this morning).

  <div>We've noticed a pretty strong response from commenters when we use the term "NoPa" on Hoodline.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div><a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/04/street-names-of-nopa" target="_blank">This article</a> in particular raised some ire about what our neighborhood should or shouldn't be called. Some said that NoPa is "artificial conjuration of realtors trying to bite off NYC-style acronyms." Others state that "'NOPA' is clumsy, inelegant, and obtuse." The theory has even circled in the comments that "NoPa is a racist construct invented by realtors so that white people could be convinced to move in the Western Addition."</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Here at Hoodline, we want to use names that residents recognize as most representative of their respective neighborhoods. With that in mind, we dug up a little history on the origins of "Western Addition," and what constitutes "NoPa" today. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Western Addition and The Outside Lands</span>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div>Western Addition was first established in 1855. It encompassed roughly 500 square blocks from Larkin Street to Divisadero Street, which had been set as San Francisco's official western border in the city's 1851 charter. That's right—San Francisco <span style="font-style: italic;">ended</span> at Divisadero. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Keep in mind that San Francisco developed from east to west, starting at the ports in the bay. The land that now boasts the Sunset, Golden Gate Park and the Richmond mostly consisted of sand dunes, with small settlements scattered here and there. The city known as San Francisco was concentrated downtown, and the "Western Addition" was its suburban neighborhood.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>This development of Western Addition was triggered by the Van Ness Ordinance, which was issued to deal with land squatters who were creating settlements on land that they didn't legally own. According to Mel Scott in his book <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xlE4hwWVqqwC&amp;amp;pg=PA43&amp;amp;lpg=PA43&amp;amp;dq=the+van+ness+ordinance&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=6OoopZawbJ&amp;amp;sig=ir3Z6hF2XYIpzjSblBTp-JkEtVk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=RL-wU8eEJYGAoQTd54DQCg&amp;amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=the%20van%20ness%20ordinance&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank">The San Francisco Bay Area: A Metropolis in Perspective</a>,</span> the ordinance had three parts and purposes. The first was to deal with the controversial issue of land titles (who owned what), the second was to reserve parts of the land for the city, and the third was to approve a city-planning map detailing the blocks from Larkin westward. <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">This mapping defined the first draft of "Western Addition" — or, the westernmost part of San Francisco. </span></div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>In the map below, drafted in 1861, you can see what was the beginning of Western Addition (to zoom in visit David Rumsey's site <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~2290~180032:City-And-County-Of-San-Francisco---" target="_blank">here</a>). </div>

  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">(Image: David <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~2290~180032:City-And-County-Of-San-Francisco---" target="_blank">Rumsey</a>)</span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">The area south and west of the charter line was known</span> as "The Outside Property" or "The Outside Lands."  It included properties west of Divisadero, but also ranches to the south and southwest.  This land was assessed under the Van Ness Ordinance as well, but remained outside of the city proper until an 1865 decree extended San Francisco's western border all the way to the Pacific. Thus "Western Addition" informally came to refer to the entire swath of the city from Larkin to the ocean.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Once streetcars became popular toward the end </span>of<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> the 19th century, Western Addition became a hot residential suburb; the area was developed rapidly, and construction boomed. (If you want to get really geeky and track down the original grantholder for the land your house is on, check out a list from the 1870s </span><a href="http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgoutwa.htm" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">here</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">.)</span><br/></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">And as the population grew, new neighborhoods began to emerge within Western Addition, generally organized around commercial strips. The "Fillmore District" was designated by city officials in the 1880s to lure residents from the original footprint of the city, which was growing overcrowded. The Richmond District followed in 1890. Japantown was moved to its current location in the wake of the 1906 earthquake. And more recently, areas like Hayes Valley, Pacific Heights and Alamo Square have become desirable neighborhoods to call home.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">Thus, more specific neighborhood names eventually gained traction within the huge area known as Western Addition.  However, in some pockets, "Western Addition" still remains the name of choice.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Western Addition Today</span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">So that's the history of Western Addition nomenclature, but what is it technically defined as today?</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">According to </span>
    <a href="http://www.sfrealtors.com/US/Neighborhood/CA/San-Francisco/Western-Addition.html" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">The San Francisco Association of Realtors</a>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">, Western Addition (which they call "the city's first multicultural neighborhood") has had its footprint reduced to the area below:</span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RSBV4DuC2qc/U7DGuOmLNYI/AAAAAAAAXaU/44NiJbe1GVw/w960-h720-no/westeraddition2.jpg.jpg" style="width: 595px;"/>

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: right;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">Of course, realtors have financial motivations in marking where neighborhood lines end and begin. However, it is worth referencing that houses listed in the shaded area above will be defined by realtors as Western Addition, and houses outside of that shading will not.  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">And it's perhaps no surprise that Western Addition has shrunk, especially in recent years. A controversial mid-century redevelopment effort displaced much of the area's long-time residents, destroying housing units, forcing businesses to close, and dividing communities via the creation of Geary Boulevard. For more details on this troubling period in San Francisco development, check out this <a href="http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Western_Addition:_A_Basic_History" target="_blank">excellent article</a> at FoundSF.</div>

    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">The borders of Western Addition have a rich and complicated history, but we were specifically curious about the neighborhood that inspired our research: the area north of the Panhandle. </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">As we mentioned earlier, the area of the city west of Divisadero technically lay just beyond Western Addition, though people still referred to it as such</span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">.  A</span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> couple of examples: In 1905 the city's Board of Supervisors </span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;"><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_fk7AQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA7&amp;amp;dq=western+addition&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=O4m1U8HAO86syASOsYDIAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=western%20addition&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank">listed several blocks</a> north of the Panhandle</span>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> as being part of Western Addition, and a </span>
    <a href="http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;amp;d=SFC19121228.2.204" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: white;">newspaper article</a>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;"> written in 1912 detailed that Hayes between Broderick and Baker was considered part of Western Addition as well. </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">So where did "NoPa" come from? It's an abbreviation of what people have been calling the area for more than 100 years. References to "North of the Panhandle" or "North of Panhandle" can be found dating back to the beginning of the 20th century.  There was even a North of Panhandle Improvement Club, a precursor to today's local neighborhood association.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">As for the term "NoPa" itself, popular belief holds that it was created by realtors looking to rebrand the neighborhood.  In fact, <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">it was actually created </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429; font-style: italic;">by </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">the neighborhood. </span></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">It turns out that the origins of NoPa grew from the </span><a href="http://wp.nopna.org/" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">North of the Panhandle Neighborhood Association</a> (NOPNA)<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">.  Created in the early 1990s, NOPNA's mission is to "establish neighborhood unity, maintain multi-ethnic, multi-cultural diversity, foster a sense of neighborhood pride, promote a safe and clean community, and improve the quality of life for all residents of the neighborhood."</span></div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">One only has to talk to residents of the neighborhood who have been here for 15+ years to learn about how drastically things have changed since NOPNA came into play. The neighborhood's crime rate has dropped, traffic on Divisadero has slowed, small businesses are finding it a vibrant area in which to open their doors, and, because of all of these factors, more people want to move here.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">According to longtime neighborhood resident and NOPNA board member James Cowan, NOPNA tried out the name "NoPa" in a couple of newsletters in the 1990s, when the organization briefly changed the title of its publication from "North Panhandle News" to "NoPa News". </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">The name didn't stick.</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">Writer Mat Honan <a href="http://www.emptyage.com/post/49311726766/nopa-prospect-heights-you-moved-away-for-a-few" target="_blank">described</a> the neighborhood in a 2000 piece for the San Francisco Bay Guardian, which might be the first published usage of the term "NoPa." In it, Honan describes the neighborhood as "struggling to define itself as gentrification takes hold."</div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">It wasn't until <a href="http://nopasf.com" target="_blank">Nopa</a> the restaurant moved in in 2006, with an odd name that required constant explanation, that the neighborhood's acronym was pushed into popular use. </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">As for the claims that "NoPa" was created by real estate moguls, James has heard rumors that "Parc North" was the proposed terminology, but that it was vetoed by residents. </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">And there you have it. Yes, NoPa is a very recent term for the neighborhood formerly known as North of the Panhandle, and it is still sometimes called Western Addition. But as current NOPNA president JJ Strahle reminds us, "There's nothing wrong with a neighborhood within a neighborhood within a city. " </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left;">So now we turn to you, readers. Do you think the name of a neighborhood matters? Or is it the accepted borders that matter more? And what do you call this neighborhood west of Divis – Western Addition, NoPa, or something else entirely?  Let us know your thoughts in the comments. </div>

  <div>It was an Independence Day weekend to forget for the owners of two cars parked on Scott Street.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>Around 1:30pm on Saturday, a Ford Expedition hit the two cars, which were parked on the northwest corner of the intersection of Scott and Haight. </div>

  <div>The other, a Toyota sedan, was hit near its rear left tire (which deflated), and appears to have been pushed onto the sidewalk where it hit a tree.</div>

  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>As of last night, neither car had been moved from the site of the accident, but the owner of at least one of them had been made aware of the collision. The Toyota had a note on its dashboard announcing that it would be towed on Monday morning, as the body shop was closed:</div>

  <p>You've probably heard by now about <a href="http://www.lavamae.org/" target="_blank">Lava Mae</a>, a new non-profit established by Doniece Sandoval to provide basic personal hygiene facilities like showers to the homeless in San Francisco.</p>
  <div>The project, which was covered by the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Buses-retrofitted-with-showers-to-roll-out-for-4891249.php" target="_blank">Chronicle</a> last fall and <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/06/21/san-francisco-shower-bus-lava-mae-gives-homeless-a-place-to-get-clean/" target="_blank">CBS News</a> just last week, is implementing a pilot program more than two years in the making: converting SFMTA buses into roving shower-and-toilet facilities for the homeless.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>According to Lava Mae's web site, the pilot program is scheduled to last until spring 2015, at which point they'll have 4 buses online and in service for showers. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The thing is, they're still raising money for the project, which is pricey since it involves purchasing and overhauling municipal buses. (You can donate <a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/LavaMae" target="_blank">here</a>.)</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Upper Haight currently lacks public showers available for the homeless, but a large portion of the city's homeless population moves in and out between Golden Gate Park and the rest of the city. We haven't heard back from Sandoval about the exact routes the buses will be on, but presumably they'll be coming around the neighborhood – <a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/LavaMae" target="_blank">especially with your support</a>. </div>

  <div>Mark your calendars for next Saturday, because we have an opportunity for you to win a free bike.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>After building out the store, moving all its inventory from multiple locations, and a soft opening in May, <a href="http://publicbikes.com/" target="_blank">Public Bikes</a> is ready to make its Hayes Valley debut official with a big party.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The flagship store at 549 Hayes Street is hosting a Grand Opening party next Saturday, July 12, from 11am-3pm. The party will take place both in the store and immediately outside on the sidewalk and the two parking spaces Public has reserved on Hayes Street. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Along with food, drinks, a photo booth, in-store deals, and prizes from local merchants, Public is hosting a raffle that could win you a free bike worth $679. The big winner will get either a <a href="http://publicbikes.com/p/PUBLIC-V7i-2014" target="_blank">Public V7i</a> or <a href="http://publicbikes.com/p/PUBLIC-C7i-2014" target="_blank">Public C7i</a> in the color of his or her choosing. Proceeds from raffle tickets go to the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The first 100 people who RSVP and show up will receive a free Public tote bag too. You can RSVP via Public's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1433481893605467/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>. </div>

  <div>We do know that the location won't go completely dark.  The co-founder of meal delivery service <a href="http://www.sprig.com" target="_blank">Sprig</a> confirmed to us yesterday that his company will be using Nectar's kitchen, at least in the short term.</div>

Today, we take you on a short walk along the Market Street strip  to compare how much the thoroughfare has changed over the years. </div>

  <div>Eagle-eyed readers may be wondering about that statue that once resided at Van Ness and Market. It looks familiar, doesn't it? Dedicated in 1906, this tribute to the troops who fought in the Spanish-American War currently resides at Dolores and Market. </div>

    <span style="font-style: italic;">

  </div>
  <div>But before becoming eye candy for Whole Foods shoppers, the 16-foot bronze statue and its granite base <a href="http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/california-volunteers.html" target="_blank">were installed at Van Ness</a>, where they lived (with one minor move) until 1925.  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>As noted in <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/06/the-lower-haight-of-yesteryear-part-four" target="_blank">our recent Lower Haight installation</a>, one of the most prominent differences in the San Francisco of yesteryear is a distinct lack of trees, made even more stark in the black and white photos. Another difference? Though the wagon wheels of a hundred years ago have been replaced by cars and SUVs, it's now nearly impossible to snap a photo of modern day Market Street without capturing a cyclist whizzing past. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>That does it for another round of Before &amp;amp; After. Stay tuned for more peeks into the past coming your way soon. </div>

  <div>We have some more details on the forthcoming restaurant planned for the <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/05/greenburger-s-closes-tonight-new-tenants-revealed" target="_blank">now-vacant space</a> at 518 Haight Street.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>Back in May, when we learned that Greenburger's would be closing, we also got wind that the location's future occupant would be Sun Hee Lee, who runs <a href="http://www.sfnarasushi.com" target="_blank">Nara Sushi</a> on Polk Street. Naturally, we wondered whether Lee was planning to bring a fourth sushi restaurant to this two-block stretch of Haight Street, joining Sushi 509, Sushi Raw, and Raijin Sushi.  But we were told that no, Lee would not be opening a sushi restaurant.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>As it turns out, that was only half true.  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Today Lee tells us that the plan is for a fusion concept offering both sushi and Korean food. There will be imported sake, beer, and wine.  And as with the Polk Street location, this restaurant will be called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nara</span>.</div>
  <div>
    <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">
      <br/>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div><span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">Lee has now started the hiring process and is pursuing permits to revamp the space, including the creation of a new bar and service area within the current dining room.  If those permits are approved and the buildout goes smoothly, expect Nara to open </span>sometime <span style="letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.428571429;">in September.</span></div>

  <div>Today, we check in on our upcoming block party, which we <a href="https://hoodline.com/2014/02/save-the-date-our-first-ever-block-party" target="_blank">mentioned</a> back in February. Progress is humming along with the date locked in for September 7th, and the plan is still to have the streets free and clear of outside vendor booths. Here are the updates we have:<br/></div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Currently the project is being underwritten by Black Scale, Derby, Diamond Supply Co., FTC, Shoe Biz and Pink Dolphin, but the hope is to lock down sponsors to fund the event in future years. Alex &amp;amp; co. are now officially permitted for the festival, and they're in the progress of getting the logistical stuff together: rerouting MUNI, setting up port-o-potties, and getting a police presence and waste management plan in place. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>The initial projection is 10,000 people, but they want to be prepared for at least 20,000, so, it's an enormous undertaking. (For reference, the estimated attendance for the <a href="http://hoodline.com/2014/06/dispatches-from-the-haight-ashbury-street-fair" target="_blank">Haight Ashbury Street Fair </a>is about 90,000.)</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Once they've got that stuff settled, they'll move on to programming. The idea is still to get DJs, but in addition, Alex and co. are also reaching out to some major local talent that they can't disclose yet. To complement the music on three major stages, there'll be a children's pavilion, and participation from Haight Street merchants, probably in the form of sales and giveaways. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>If you've got suggestions for programming you'd like to see,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> they're looking for feedback</span>. Leave it in the comments. And we'll keep you updated as things progress. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>In other street fair news, we may not have Upper Haight Sunday Streets yet, but the Richmond does. On Sunday, July 13 from 11am-4pm, Arguello will be closed from Fulton to Lake for Sunday Streets. On the agenda this year: dance performances, bike lessons for kids, balloon making, Zumba, the Clement Street Farmer's Market, and more. </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>Sunday Streets is also looking for volunteers for the event, and you can RSVP, and check out all the other details <a href="http://www.sundaystreetssf.com/richmond-71314/" target="_blank">here</a>. </div>

  <div><a href="http://hellocheetle.com/" target="_blank">Hello, cheetle</a> is an independent small business run by neighborhood locals Amber Schadewald and Britt Spangler. Specializing in creating “care packs for care-free babes,” their products include a collection of goods for festival-goers and a survival kit for a night out on the town (and its aftermath). </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>All of the packs are geared toward women, and many are sourced from other local female entrepreneurs. We stopped by to learn more about their company and what this “cheetling” business was all about.</div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SMjz5VkGDxSF7FFr40n12g5SH9_qLVavoeetQNQBoo1G=w960-h720-p-no" style="width: 595px;"/>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>Amber and Britt met as Craigslist roommates about two years ago and became fast friends. It was during this time that they inadvertently first began “developing” their unique brand philosophy.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>“We were pretty wild back then,” Amber told us. “There was lots of slipping under fences and getting backstage at rock shows…canoodling with all kinds of interesting characters. We had a name for that kind of behavior. We called it ‘cheetling.’”</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>Although hard to pin down exactly, it seems that Amber and Britt are all about promoting an adventurous spirit, fostering creative expression and, in general, holding the art of mischief as something sacred. All of this is tempered by a deep belief in cultivating a community of women and providing products that help ladies both into, and out of, a certain amount of trouble.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>“We wanted to build a company based on our own experiences and lifestyles. Beforehand, we were working for corporations and toward other people's visions or lifestyles, and now we get to speak for ourselves,” said Britt.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>The two officially launched their company in April 2014, and it is currently operating entirely out of their shared apartment just off Divisadero Street. Both 28 years old, Amber comes from a professional writing background, while Britt has experience in marketing. However, many of the skills they’ve needed to learn to start their business, such as building and maintaining their retail <a href="http://www.hellocheetle.com" target="_blank">website</a>,  have been learned along the way.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>In addition to their online shop, which also features a blog, Britt and Amber host a rock and roll radio show on Mission based <a href="http://bff.fm/" target="_blank">BFF.fm</a>. Tune in on Fridays from 6pm–8pm to hear the two talk about shenanigans and spin “ear rippers, bangers, wavy ones, and drugg drones.”</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>So what, exactly, comes in these packs? The ladies took the time to open one of their neatly wrapped square boxes and show us what’s inside.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/COz4eQSC2EEPijP_kL4blFE1qyw7vQEqHjrWFrFxY2sh=w960-h720-p-no" style="width: 595px;"/>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div>We took a look at the “<a href="http://hellocheetle.com/products/come-hither-pack" target="_blank">come hither pack</a>” and, true to form, it provides goods they feel a girl might need to “woo a new lover and then keep him around in the morning.” Contents include:</div>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Sounds like a good time!</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>All partying aside, Amber and Britt are also very much in the business of promoting the lifestyles of other like-minded females and cultivating a community in which folks like them can thrive, both as customers and collaborators. When asked about their general feelings toward the company they are building, Amber replied:</div>
  <div> </div>
  <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
    <div>“I’m reflective of the fond memories I have of these large all-ladies dinners we used to have. We called them ‘lady dinners’. Feeling that strong sense of support, and knowing that I could ask people of anything and I would do the same for them. Essentially, we want a cheetle network. It just feels good supporting other people doing what they love. We also want be friends with all these rad chicks.”</div>
  </blockquote>
  <div> </div>
  <div>As far as the future goes, the girls want to keep growing their network and hope to pursue everything from building a clubhouse to starting a record label to landing their own reality TV show. But for now, the two seem quite content with what they’ve accomplished and the direction they’re heading.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>“We want to see lots of cheetles running around with packs doing lovely, mischievous things and being prepared for it. We want a cheetle revolution.”</div>
