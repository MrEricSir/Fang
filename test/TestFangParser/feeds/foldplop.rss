<p>Unfortunately, work and school are leaving me with little time for music these days, but that EP <em>is</em> happening eventually…</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>I've implemented a commenting system for news and releases, so you can now easily give 
feedback! :)</p>

<p>It's been over a year since I last released anything, but I am currently putting together an 
EP with various old and new tracks. Stay tuned...</p>

	<title>Foldplop article and new home</title>
	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>Reid Bridgeman wrote a nice <a href="http://www.skagit.edu/file_upload/SVCCardinalNews_120315.pdf">article</a> about me in the Skagit Valley College Cardinal newspaper (page 9)! :) Here's a <a href="http://static.foldplop.com/misc/foldplop-cardinal.png">screenshot</a> for those who can't view PDF files. Thanks, Reid!</p>

<p>In other news, I've just moved and my new home studio is still under construction. Once it's done, though, it'll be better than ever! I have a few different projects going on and hope to have something to release during the summer.</p>

	<title>Foldplop - Lambda Fantasy on my new YouTube channel</title>
	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>I set up a new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Foldplop">YouTube channel</a> that I'm going to devote to music. I moved the old Timelines video there and made one for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ0M0h9u8z4">Lambda Fantasy</a>!</p>

<p>Both of these are relatively simple Quartz Composer visualizations with no narrative. One of these days I hope I'll find the time to make a proper video...</p>

	<title>I love Web 2.0 buttons!</title>
	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>Not really, but I decided to add a few at the bottom of the page anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSS button for the feed that's been around since the introduction of the new site, to give it a bit more visibility.</li>
<li>A link to my <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> profile, if you want to see what kind of music I listen to.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> button. Flattr is a fairly new microdonation system where you allocate a monthly sum of money to donate and it gets spread out amongst people whose Flattr buttons you click. It's the coolest donation system concept I've come across, so I decided to give it a try. If you like my music and want to support me financially, you can now Flattr me! :)</li>
</ul>

	<title>Music player added</title>
	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>There is now a Flash music player on the home page, so you can listen without having to download any release zips. The MP3s it plays are encoded as LAME V2, which I hope should be a decent compromise between quality and file size.</p>

	<title>The new site is live!</title>
	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>As you can see, the new version of the Foldplop website is now up and running! There are still some back-end things I need to fix, but it is usable at least.</p>

<p>I will be adding a comment system later to encourage feedback. :) In the meantime, you can still e-mail me if you have something to say -- the address is foldplop at foldplop dot com.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
	    <p>I am in the process of rewriting the site! This new version is database-driven and much easier to update. Here's a news post to confirm that my code actually works. :3</p>
