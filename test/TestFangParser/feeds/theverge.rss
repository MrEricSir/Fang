    <title>Twitpic changes course yet again, will now be shutting down on October 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42072784/iPhone_TwitPic_hands-on.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Twitpic, one of the first Twitter image-sharing services, continues to toy with our emotions. A few months ago, the service said &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6106735/twitpic-is-dead-because-twitter-killed-it"&gt;it would be shutting down&lt;/a&gt; at the end of September, then it said it was &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/18/6445597/twitpic-says-it-wont-be-shutting-down-after-all"&gt;granted a new lease on life&lt;/a&gt; just a few days before it was set to go up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Twitpic is changing course, yet again. According to an &lt;a href="http://blog.twitpic.com/2014/09/twitpic-is-shutting-down/" target="_blank"&gt;update to its blog&lt;/a&gt;, the service will cease to exist as of October 25th. Despite the fact that the Twitpic felt confident enough that it found a new home to retract its &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; shutdown alert, the company now says that it couldn't come to "agreeable terms" with its new partner. At least the company admits the situation is a bit ridiculous, saying it is "embarrassed" for the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course,...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Apple's iPad Air 2 shows that tablet photography is here to stay</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42060472/tablet-photography-1_2040.0.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Not long after the original iPad debuted, I was home for the holidays and saw a husband take a picture of his wife at a bar with a BlackBerry PlayBook. Being from a small town that always seems a bit behind the times, it surprised me that he had the new PlayBook in the first place, let alone that it was his camera of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an easy sight to laugh at then, and it’s remained an easy target — just look at how a large swath of Twitter reacted when, at &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6988171/apple-ipad-air-2-touch-id-fingerprint-sensor-announced"&gt;today’s Apple event&lt;/a&gt;, Phil Schiller said that the iPad Air 2 is "the best viewfinder for composing your photos and your videos":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is promoting iPad photography and I have never been more upset with that company...&lt;/p&gt;
— Austin Hunt (@iAustinHunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iAustinHunt/status/522807176730259457"&gt;October 16, 2014&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Why is Apple's $999 display stuck in 2011?</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42063000/AppleThunderbolt.0.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Apple's new &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6984755/apple-imac-with-retina-display-announced"&gt;iMac with Retina display&lt;/a&gt; is very pretty and useful, but in the same places where it's made leaps and bounds, it's also made one of Apple's other pieces of Mac hardware look like a relic, and an increasingly obvious mistake if you were to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>'Minecraft' movie may be made by 'Night at the Museum' director</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42062830/Minecraft-360.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/i&gt; made it clear that a film based on a plotless, block-based property could somehow be wildly successful and really funny, so we really ought to be looking forward to the upcoming &lt;i&gt;Minecraft &lt;/i&gt;movie. Work on the movie &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/27/5454784/a-minecraft-movie-may-be-coming-to-a-theater-near-you"&gt;was first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="http://deadline.com/2014/10/minecraft-movie-shawn-levy-director-warner-bros-852503/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deadline&lt;/i&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Shawn Levy, director of children's films like &lt;i&gt;Cheaper by the Dozen &lt;/i&gt;and the &lt;i&gt;Night at the Museum &lt;/i&gt;series, is in talks to direct and develop it. Producers behind &lt;i&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt; are already on board, which definitely seems like a good sign. It otherwise doesn't sound like work on &lt;i&gt;Minecraft&lt;/i&gt; has gotten too far, which means there's no word yet on what the movie will actually be like or how many hours of it will involve watching someone hit...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The SIM card is about to die</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42057016/DSC00488.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;If there's one thing I've learned about Apple's dealings with SIM cards in the past seven years, it's that Apple gets what Apple wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little gold-plated circuits — which identify you as a subscriber on a particular carrier — plug into phones, tablets, and basically anything else with a cellular radio. Customers of GSM carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have been using them since time immemorial; CDMA carriers like Sprint and Verizon have started using them since switching to LTE. Apple hates SIMs, and has hated them for as long as the iPhone has existed: it is known to have &lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/1/3057577/etsi-euicc-embedded-sim-apple"&gt;explored the use of embedded, non-removable SIMs&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6988695/apples-ipad-air-2-lets-you-pick-from-multiple-wireless-carriers-with-one-SIM"&gt;with the iPad Air 2 and mini 3&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has decided to start making its move by using a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder is building a fortress in the desert for 'Batman v. Superman'</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42058166/ss.0.0_standard_800.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Batman v. Superman &lt;/i&gt;is shaping up to be an absolutely huge movie given that it has Zack Snyder behind the camera and at least a good five or so superheroes in it. So naturally, Snyder and crew are building at least one big set to go along with all of that. Albuquerque's KOAT &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rgp4doS0xE"&gt;caught them at work&lt;/a&gt; on a set out in the desert around Deming, New Mexico. It's not totally clear what the structure is just yet, but it looks like it encompasses a number of large buildings and potentially some guard towers forming a town, settlement, or fortress. You'll find out just how destroyed it all gets &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5976165/batman-v-superman-release-date-moves-away-from-marvel"&gt;on March 25th, 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy an iPad mini 2 while you still can</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42050972/ipadmini3.0.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, spent roughly 29 seconds talking about the brand new iPad mini 3 today. Schiller is a man who's normally eager to showcase his company's latest hardware achievements, but this afternoon he sped over the 7.9-inch tablet in record time. There was a single slide dedicated to what's gone into the "upgraded" iPad mini. Apart from the addition of Touch ID, nothing looked different from last year. Apart from Touch ID, nothing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; different from last year. And yet by the end of today's event, Apple somehow wound up with &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; iPads in its product family. Something's gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OS X Yosemite is now available to download</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/41978364/mac-os-x-yosemite-theverge-1_1020.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Apple's latest desktop operating system, OS X Yosemite, is &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12" target="_blank"&gt;now available to download&lt;/a&gt; from the Mac App Store. It's a free update, and it delivers a whole host changes, most notably a revamped visual style that's a lot more colorful than the OS X you're used to. In fact, the Yosemite makes your Mac's operating system look a lot more like iOS than traditional OS X, and it brings the two operating systems together in a few more ways too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest features in Yosemite is the ability for it to let you move your work between your Mac, iPhone, and iPad and then pick up exactly where you left off on another device. It also adds a few smaller — but still quite useful – integrations with iOS, such as the ability to send and receive text...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A 'Twin Peaks' novel will fill fans in on the show's 25-year time gap</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42054122/twin-peaks.0.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;There were immediately questions when, earlier this month, it was announced that a "Twin Peaks" miniseries is &lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/twin-peaks-book-to-reveal-tv-show-characters-fates/"&gt;coming to Showtime&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, what had the characters been doing for the past quarter-century? How had the iconic mystery affected the town? Had Dale Cooper's caffeine problem spun out of control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be getting some answers before the new series airs in 2016. A novel, from "Twin Peaks" co-creator Mark Frost, is coming next year, and promises to catch us up on what "happened to the people of that iconic fictional town since we last saw them 25 years ago," according to &lt;a href="http://macmillan.supadu.com/images/ckfinder/704/pdfs/Macmillan/TwinPeaks10-16-14.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; form the book's publisher, Flatiron Books. The story will also delve deeper into the central mystery of the series, the death of Laura Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reports $16.52 billion in revenue, profits stutter as ads move to mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/42052814/google-logo-stock1_2040.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Google posted mixed results for its third quarter this year. Revenue was $16.52 billion, not excluding traffic acquisition costs, a 20 percent rise over the same period in 2013. But its profit of $3.72 billion was down slightly from the same period in 2013, when it reported $3.76 billion in profit. Analysts were expecting the company to generate earnings per share of $6.53, but Google reported an EPS of $6.35. The stock was down a little, about 3 percent, based largely on that miss.&lt;/p&gt;
