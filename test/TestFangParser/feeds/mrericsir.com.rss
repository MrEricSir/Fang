<p>A mural recently appeared on the side of the former Andalu space at 16th and Guerrero.  Apparently there&#8217;s more to come, as a large sign proclaims that the space is &#8220;reserved.&#8221;  Stay tuned for further updates as the mural progresses.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco is seven by seven miles.  Everyone who lives here knows that.  There&#8217;s even a <a href="http://www.7x7.com/">magazine</a> named after this fact.</p>
<p>Problem is, it&#8217;s not exactly true.  </p>
<p>While the <em>land </em>area is about 49 square miles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco#Geography">as Wikipedia points out</a> the total area is a much larger 232 square miles when you include water.  Aside from a sizable portion of the bay and some of its islands, San Francisco also includes the Farallon Islands and surrounding water in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s actual borders are easy to visualize <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/111968">using OpenStreetMap</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrericsir.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sfboundary.jpg"><img src="http://www.mrericsir.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sfboundary-1024x442.jpg" alt="" title="Boundaries of SF" width="550" height="237" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2802" /></a></p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering where OpenStreetMap is getting this data, it&#8217;s straight from the US Census <a href="http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/">TIGER data</a>.  The same information can be viewed on their website, albeit with some difficulty.</p>
<p>One more thing: (Spoiler alert!) Despite what many seem to think, SFO is not located in San Francisco; it&#8217;s entirely in San Mateo County.  So if you&#8217;re ever wondering why the airport doesn&#8217;t have SF&#8217;s trademark urine, pot, and beer smell, that&#8217;s probably why.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately we&#8217;ve heard a lot about wearable tech.  It&#8217;s said to be an exciting new product category that involves smartwatches, Google Glass, and perhaps fitness trackers.</p>
<p>But how many of the people talking about this future of wearable gadgets are wearing wristwatches, glasses, or contact lenses?  And how many of them are wearing clothes and shoes made from fabrics that didn&#8217;t exist a century ago?</p>
<p>Wearable tech isn&#8217;t the future, it&#8217;s the present.  Just because we don&#8217;t always think of elastic underwear or an old-timey wind up watch as &#8220;tech&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So what are we <em>really</em> talking about when we discuss this seemingly inevitable rise of gadgets we strap to ourselves?</p>
<p>Essentially, we&#8217;re lumping together products designed to put on our bodies that are futuristic in the sense that they&#8217;re not very good yet.  They all suffer from one or more of the following flaws:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Uncomfortable</strong><br />Is Google Glass really something you&#8217;d be able to wear all day?  And aren&#8217;t your fingers too fat for a smartwatch touch screen?
</li>
<li><strong>Doesn&#8217;t work well</strong><br />Early digital watches required users <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/296609/the-digital-watch-a-brief-history/2">to press a button to see the time.</a>  Existing analog watches didn&#8217;t have this problem.  Most new products take years to get right.</li>
<li><strong>Not useful enough</strong><br />Microsoft launched a smartwatch called SPOT <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9927213-1.html">nearly ten years ago.</a>  It wasn&#8217;t on the market for long.  Why?  Most people at that time were buying cell phones that offered more features.  It&#8217;s one thing to have an extra gadget (or ten) around the house that you don&#8217;t use, but the bar for usefulness is much higher if you have to put it on when you get up in the morning.
</li>
<li><strong>Looks silly</strong><br />Would you wear a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/93619834/unique-beadwork-beard">fake beard made out of colorful beads?</a>  While most people would have no problem wearing one on Halloween, on most days wearing something visible and unusual in public has a social stigma.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point is, we need to stop talking about HUDs and newfangled computer watches as though they belong together.  These are very different gadgets with discrete feature sets &#8212; and different problems to overcome.</p>
<p>Even as buzzwords go, wearable tech isn&#8217;t meaningful: it&#8217;s unnecessary, not descriptive, and even if it were it still wouldn&#8217;t be a product category in and of itself.  It&#8217;s time to shut up about wearable tech and let this buzzword die.  </p>

<p>Good news, everyone!  Disneyland is coming to the Mission!</p>
<p>A <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2013/11/stencils_in_the_shadows_two_ar.php">recent street stencil</a> breaks the news.  I called up Disney&#8217;s headquarters for more information.  Here&#8217;s the scoop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike Disney&#8217;s other parks, this one will be both &#8220;haute&#8221; and &#8220;edgy&#8221; with cast members playing hobos, hipsters, and street drunks.  Keeping with the theme, a scary Tomorrowland ride called BART will whisk you from one end of the park to the other.  </p>
<p></li>
<li>There will be plenty of places to eat, although they&#8217;re all a bit expensive for what you get.  And of course there will be numerous gift shops selling cheap junk at ridiculous prices &#8212; but you&#8217;ll buy a souvenir anyway because that&#8217;s what people do.
<p></li>
<li>Other attractions will include Goofy&#8217;s Art Alley, The Hunchback of San Francisco de Asis, Haunted Denim Shop&#8217;s Ghostly Price Tag Scare, and Snow White&#8217;s Naughty Vibrator Emporium.  When you&#8217;re done, why not relax in Kermit the Frog&#8217;s Dolores Park Village?
<p></li>
<li>Be prepared for long lines.  You might want to bring something to read, and be sure to wear comfortable shoes.</ul>
